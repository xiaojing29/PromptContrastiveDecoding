However, the source text seems to be incomplete. It ends abruptly with "Translate to English". Assuming the complete text is "ତଥାପି, ମନ୍ଥର ଯୋଗାଯୋଗ ମାଧ୍ୟମ ଯୋଗୁଁ, ପାଶ୍ଚାତ୍ୟର ଶୈଳୀ 25 ରୁ 30 ବର୍ଷ ପଛରେ ରହିପାରେ।", here's the translation:
The Middle Ages saw the development of a style in Western Europe that was emulated by the Arabs. People used to wear turbans for headgear, and this practice had a significant impact, much like an experiment, resulting in a major success of that time.
Agricultural farming is just to fulfill the needs of the farmer and his family, which is sufficient for food production.
Irrigation is a simple, often biological, pipeline in which production growth is achieved by using the collected seeds of the local region along with the cultivated crop in the cultivation phase or any other expected simple method is used.
From a historical perspective, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Sub-culture, bringing together people with a similar perspective, who feel marginalized by social norms and giving them a sense of belonging and identity.
The age of the individuals, their lineage, class, status, and/or gender can cause sub-culture to be different.
Special cases, where a sub-culture is interpreted in different ways, can be explained by linguistic, cultural, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
A subculture member typically signifies their membership in a distinctive and symbolic manner through fashion, behavior, and argot, which are all combined.
The importance of socialization is often highlighted by narrating the unfortunate event of a child being abused, neglected, or tortured by an adult, thereby keeping social norms at bay.
These children are labeled as "feral" or wild-eyed. Some feral children have been kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents) in certain regions; in some areas, parents have discarded a child due to their serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are abandoned or orphaned may experience excessive child abuse or mental trauma before being abandoned.
Many animals are said to be infested by others; some are said to be living in the forest themselves.
Whenever animals are completely taken care of by non-human beings, then the usage of a child (within the physical limits) becomes almost completely like that of a special animal that is taken care of by humans, that is to say, as if a human being is free from all fear or loneliness.
Project-based learning, while making it easy and more attractive at times, scaffolding takes it to another level ahead.
Scalfolding is not a method of training, but rather an aid that assists individuals in experiencing a new computer program or starting a new project, similar to a new learning experience.
A Scaphold can be both imaginary and real, or in other words, a teacher can be a kind of Scaphold and a Microsoft Office document can also be a kind of Scaphold.

We expect our KIYAR system to provide a secure home, a loving philosophy, healthy education, and reliable health services.
Before, they were taken from their homes, and it is ordered that whatever necessities were not available there, should be supplied by the Foyster Car.
Both online gathering and reciprocal interaction are characteristics that combine on the internet.
The excessive use and satisfaction of the internet has led to an excessive expectation of its separate utilities.
Examples such as "Learning" and "Socialising in Society" are presented as a crucial prediction for the use of the Internet (James Et al., 1995).
While analyzing the responses of viewers on the website, Igmore and MacCard (1998) identified "personal relationship" and "continuous relationship" as new motivational components.
The use of video recordings has led to the discovery of a crucial process in the functioning of micro-expressions, which is a few milliseconds in duration.
In particular, it is claimed that one can accurately interpret the micro-expressions of a person and know whether they are lying or not.
Oliver Sachs displays in his essay and in the President's speech that in a more abstract sense, people suffer from the damage of the speech in understanding it, therefore, it will never be possible to evaluate it correctly and accurately.
She also says that the ability to understand human behavior is as rare as a skill possessed by animals, such as dogs.
Two types of genetic mutations have been known from the research of the 20th century: Lethal and Expressible.
Mutation adds a new hereditary variation and selection eliminates it from the design of manifest variation.
Each generation along with individuality and re-creation is changing ahead and behind between two poles.
In the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system, the necessity of its amino-acid supplementation from the available nutrient resources is a challenge.
Excessive indulgence in this manner will lead to dire consequences: decline in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Letters and leaves of the Simba family of edible plants are rich in proteins, easily available in abundance, but if we cook them, they become as difficult to digest as our primeval ancestors.
On the other side, animal feed grains (pimpuri, oi, dimb) are not just supplementary, but also add high-quality, amino acid-rich, multi-dimensional proteins.
If we consider all matters, even if our ancestors had somewhat solved the "protein problem" for us, just as we are simulating it today, then we wouldn't be astonished.
In a dream, your subconscious mind is awake and the process of dreaming takes place, and after a short period of time (10–60 minutes) the dreamer wakes up.

Science has been indicating that this vast carbon economy system has been broken down into its constituent parts from its stable kingdom in the biosphere, which has been supporting human development for the past 2 million years.
In each society, a part of the population adopts and uses transportation systems. Mostly, everyone adopts and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you hear the same level of complaint about the quality of water or the water pressure.
How do transportation systems benefit from such a huge advantage, yet fail daily in their foundations? Are transportation machines simply incapable, or are there some more fundamental tasks still going on?
Traffic flow refers to the movement of vehicles between two separate locations as well as the operation of those vehicles and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic management is a difficult task because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
In principle, the behavior of drivers is confined within a limited stable boundary; similarly, there is some degree of stability in traffic flow streams, and it can be approximately mathematically represented.
To effectively represent traffic flow, three main characteristics are interrelated: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Road infrastructure planning, design, and management are assisted by these.

Blogs help students in improving their writing skills. Whenever students start writing blogs with grammar and syntax, their blogging knowledge begins, and it generally changes the presence of viewers.
As students are often overburdened with too many complex subjects, bloggers, in an attempt to improve their writing, have started to make an effort.
In addition, the blog states, "The students are compelled to acquire knowledge about the four walls of the world." The necessity of fulfilling the expectations of the viewers compels the students to become four and agitated. (Toto, 2004)
Blogging is a tool, which inspires collaboration and encourages students to explore alternative forms of education, rather than traditional classroom learning.
The proper use of blogs will enable students to scrutinize and critique more thoroughly and critically; active participation in online discussions will enable students to describe their own position in relation to others' writings, along with pinpointing specific problems on which they focus their perspectives (Orahevich, 2002).
