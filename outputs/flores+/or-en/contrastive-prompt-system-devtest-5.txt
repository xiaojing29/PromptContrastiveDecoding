Whenever a living being has a small group (a small community) of its own, they become separate from the main community from which they came (just as they would be if they were a series of mountains or a river flowing, or if they were to reach a new island from which they could not easily return) and they generally find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
In this new environment, there are various sources and competitors, so what was necessary before the new population will have to be expected from a powerful competitor, requiring various features or adaptation.
The main population has not changed, they still require the same usage of the past.
In time, the new generation will start moving ahead with a new environment, along with a new way of living, and as a result, they will see less and less of other communities.

In reality, 35mm format, somewhat ambiguously, is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this format is a parameter (to get the simple ratio of the proportion of bars by dividing into 3:2 ratio).
Many common formats (such as the example APA style format) are similar or proportional to this measurement ratio.
