For instance, one can say that a car necessarily becomes the cause of the road's construction.
In reality, a non-state owned road network is not economically viable for the sake of profit, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.

One of the most obvious ways to highlight the importance of social norms is to draw attention to some of the unfortunate incidents involving children, which were ignored, mishandled, or covered up due to negligence or malice, and which, through the agency of the media, were exposed as socially unacceptable.
Children of this category are often referred to as "wild" or "feral". A few wild children are kept by humans (usually their parents) in captivity. In some cases, children are abandoned by their parents due to their severe mental or physical disability.
