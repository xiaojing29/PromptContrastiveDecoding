This not only confirms the widely accepted theory that some dinosaurs had hair, but also provides additional details that general fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal is brown like a guava at the top and pale or carrot-like in color at the bottom.
The discovery of this matter also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers in depth as well.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis, but possessed other characteristics of bird feathers, such as fluffy and barbs, researchers conclude that the rachis likely evolved after these other characteristics.
The structure of the fur suggests that these fur were not for flying, but for temperature control or just beauty more than that. Researchers point out that even though this is a young dinosaur tail, the specimen shows that it is a fully grown bird feather, not a juvenile feather.

Jobs that are completed are mostly done according to theory, but this program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team wants is likely to occur from tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
The Sagittarius A* sends a gravitational pull towards the galaxy, just like the moon's gravitational pull towards the Earth causes a tidal wave.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a manner similar to normal matter itself.
This theory states that dark matter around a galaxy is located around one galaxy in a spherical radius and is formed from a large number of small particles.

In France, voting uses technology only a little differently from the old pattern, with voters being isolated in booths, taking a printed ballot paper listing candidates and placing it in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the eligible voter, the voter must deposit the envelope into the ballot box and sign their name in the voter registration list.
The electoral laws of France have a fairly strict procedural framework.
Since 1988 onwards, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can be eyewitnesses that no envelope is in the box before voting begins, and no envelope is added except for the envelope of a qualified voter's vote, which will be counted as appropriate.
Applicants can send a representative to participate as a witness in every step. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict control and supervision according to a specific process.

I don't know if you know or not, but most of the products from the US that enter this country are duty-free.
Despite that, 80% of our products are subject to customs duties in various countries in Central America. We treat you.
It doesn't seem fair at all to me, it's definitely unfair.
Treat us the way you would like to be treated.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
A proposed law requires violent video games sold in California to be labeled with an "18" sticker, and anyone who violates the law by selling these games to minors will be fined $1,000.
Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce.

Chewbacca's blaster fire misses its mark between aiming at the head of the fifth man, Chewbacca suffers from chronic pain, loses one eye, has a partially missing skull, and gets a new face with titanium.
Chneider passed through a video link from a US Air Force base in his hometown.
Following the Wednesday event, Carapaz participated in two competitions to claim the speed throne.
Her first was a sprint, in which she did not finish in her first outing. Thirty-six of the 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In other competitions, such as the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category, with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, behind Claudia Loesch, who was first by 2:11.60 minutes, and Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who was ninth by 1:09.02 minutes.
Four female skiers on the list were unable to reach the finish line, and 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in the Giant Slalom competition were unable to qualify for the rankings.
The Metropolitan Police can track a stolen laptop back to its owner using a mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector D.K. Araya said, "We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspects are Baba Kanchard, Putha Kanchard, Rampro Kanchard, Gasa Kanchard, and Vishnu Kanchard.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, said that the suspect appeared in court with their face covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the time of the collision, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
Temporary road closures are in place following a car collision. Emergency services are extracting the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he was treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was moved to Adenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been held in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on a charge of murdering his own son since then.
She was held in custody while awaiting indictment and trial in court, but a personal witness to the event may not have much weight due to her image being widely disseminated.
In other places within the United Kingdom, this is a common approach, but the justice process in Scotland does not work in this way, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, a lecturer at the University of Dundee, said, "It appears that journalists are walking down a dangerous path if they release all these images of the suspect to the public."
The Attorney General's Office, which is responsible for filing and prosecuting cases in general, clearly informed the press that there will be no further comments until at least a case is filed.
Based on the leaked news, this document will refer to the dispute over the border which Palestine demands, citing the pre-1967 Middle East War border.
Reports indicate that other issues include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred border for both countries, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is calling for the continued military presence for 10 years, following the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority has agreed to a 5-year presence only.
Rifle unit personnel in the experimental project are closely monitored by wildlife rangers, as this experimental project is being tracked and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Australian National Pistol Association (NSW), suitable volunteers are selected under the Game Hunter Program of the Australian National Pistol Association.
Citing Mick O'Connell, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the National Park, in conjunction with NPWS, it is said that the four selected marksmen received comprehensive training and safety guidance.
Yesterday, Martelli swore in the new nine-member Electoral Council for the Transition (ECT).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in a four-year cycle.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended that the CEP's resignation, which occurred earlier, be part of the measures to lead the country to a new election.
Martelli appointed such a commission to counter the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have been triggered by election management failures, which sometimes date back to 2011.
There have been reports of iPod malfunctioning to the point of overheating excessively in approximately 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor injuries to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the equipment in question.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious" incidents.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the postponement of Apple's report as "something that is extremely unlikely to happen."
A tsunami struck the Marshall Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 UTC on a Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office announced that there have been no reports of damage within the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also indicates that there are no signs at all that a tsunami will occur.
A former Filipino police officer took a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendosoa shoots a rifle M 16 at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with a Filipino photographer.
Later, many photographers came to replace the elderly woman as she had to go to the restroom. Mendos was shot and defeated.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a surgeon and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in her spare time, Liggins began collecting data on preterm labor.
His research shows that the use of hormones accelerates the growth of fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that two "black boxes" from the flight data recorders of two aircraft were recovered by government investigators on Wednesday.
Many of her wrestling friends also praised and admired Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on a night with two moons, which was as unique as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Riddick expressed, "Luna's a little crazy just like me... maybe even crazier... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the federal election in 2010, the percentage who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Julia Gillard, the then Acting Prime Minister, said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
From a survey with the most extreme opinions, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic at all.
The gold medalist in this Olympics must swim the 100m freestyle and 200m freestyle, and also swim three relays in the commonwealth games, but his complaint raises doubts about his physical ability.
He cannot use the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are prohibited from using these medications in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many people have checked and confirmed the accuracy of the discovery by using different hardware and software within early February, and an announcement was made about this on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are a source of water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and aid in sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly the formation of the Earth, ever since a comet struck the Earth long ago.
Ciuoamo, 53, took office as regional governor at the start of this year and last month signed a draft law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He calls this news a "meaningless political talk and foolishness"
It is forecasted that he will run for the position of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, and also reduce carbon emissions.
The technology used is satellite-based, different from the old ground-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers accurately locate aircraft positions and provide pilots with precise and accurate information.
There is no additional transportation service and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and on the ground there is no parking space and a parking place with a link to public transportation.
The fear of a transportation shortage makes it possible that this game will be played quietly without the team's supporters.
A study published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved within just two generations, much faster than expected, as a result of interbreeding between the Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
We can shape gold into various forms and can melt it into tiny shapes.
Gold can be drawn into a thin thread, which can be bent and knitted into patterns, and can also be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
Gold can be made into thin sheets and attached to other metals. It can be made very thin, to the point that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which are called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can create an indicator by using red cabbage water.
The color of the cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value will be indicated by the amount of ions present in hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that loses an electron (since the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron each).
Mix the two dry powders together, then use a clean and wet hand to squeeze them into a spherical shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will give you a strange feeling and form in the shape of a shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Wastewater treatment systems were discovered in the homes of various cities in the Minoan civilization of Crete and at Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilet rooms. In ancient Roman civilization, sometimes the toilet room was part of a public bathhouse, which was used by both men and women together.
When you call someone who is far away, thousands of miles away, that means you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space using rockets. Scientists need space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts and bends our view of some aspects.
It requires a giant crane over 100 feet tall to lift a satellite or a telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in an unbelievable way. The greatest thing that wheels have given us is making transportation more convenient and faster.
It gives us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Beyond them are medium-sized lions and tigers, which prey on medium-sized prey from rabbits to deer and hares.
In the end, there are many small cats (including open system domestic cats) that eat a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards of the gecko genus, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of territory, which is a special work that each cat holds onto to prevent them from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social of all cats by living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult male lions, along with several females and their cubs, often numbering up to 30.
Because it is a large family consisting of sisters and daughters, the female often has a close relationship with each other.
Lion cubs exhibit behavior similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs, which is a remarkable similarity to lions (but not at all like large cats in general), and they are also a serious threat to their prey as well.
The tiger is an athlete who is agile. It has the ability to climb (although not very good at it) swim, jump far, and pull with a strength five times that of a human being that is strong.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar (Panthera genus). All four of these cats are the only animals that can roar.
The screech of a squirrel is different from the loud roar of a lion, but rather like a shouted threat, screeching one word after another.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that wild cats catch are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and stalk prey (victims) by sniffing out where their prey has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with their nocturnal efficiency and move stealthily. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending into its surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a living group (a small population with a low number) splits off from the main population (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return to their original location) these living beings often find themselves in a different environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will have to have different qualifications or the ability to adapt to become a stronger competitor than before.
The indigenous population has not changed in the slightest. They still need to adapt in the same way as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they will increasingly resemble other populations.
After passing through hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations eventually became so different that they could no longer be considered the same living organism.
We call this process the process of speciation, which means the creation of a new species. The process of speciation is an inevitable result and is considered a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen gas that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide gas that humans exhale (which is exhalation) into.
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We cultivate plants to build houses and make them into clothing and food that we mostly eat, which are mostly plants. If there were no plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaur was the ultimate predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long mandible is fully equipped with more than 70 sharp, pointed teeth, like a knife, as well as a special set of teeth on the palate, which means nothing that enters will survive.
We are not certain, but it may have had two spines. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other Mosasaurs, and it may have also been a predator itself.
It attacks anything that goes into the water as well, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus Rex is no match for it.
Most of the Roman diet would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had unusual foods or special dishes for banquets, such as wild boar, peacock, oysters, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that while the poor and that woman eat while sitting on a chair, the rich enjoy eating lavishly together, where they sit reclined sideways while eating.
It is impossible to count the number of American or Asian foods that entered Europe over several centuries and were later considered food of the ancient Romans.
For example, ancient Romans did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted the flavor of chicken.
The Babylonians built the main temple, which was considered a house for each of the gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and priests would attempt to follow the gods' wishes through rituals and various festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard, followed by a lower temple area that only monks can enter.
Sometimes a special stepped pyramid tower called a zigurat is built as part of a temple.
The tower is a special place of worship for the gods.
The climate in the Middle East is warm, so houses are not very important.
The Jewish family lived mostly in an open space.
Women will cook in the field, shops are just counters that face the street, and stones are used to build houses.
The land of Canaan has no large forests at all, so wood is extremely expensive.
There are only a few settlers in Finland. According to Norse legend, Eric the Red was banished from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he was a discoverer, the Inuit people had already inhabited the area at that time.
Although each country is a "Scandinavia", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are quite different.
If you've seen the movie Operation Golden Phoenix, Treasure of the World, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true, even though there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map after all.
The text written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776," which appears at the bottom of the document when it is laid flat.
Although it is unclear who the author is, we know that in early life this large animal skin document (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that a note has been added in the form of a label.
The Normandy Landings and the subsequent fighting released northern France from German occupation, but the south remained occupied.
It is governed here by the French from the "Vichy regime", which were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
American forces and the Free French Forces liberated southern France to independence and turned towards Germany within just two weeks.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in society.
The term "อารยธรรม" (civilization) comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning civilian, related to "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or state, and also defines the scope of society.
The state is a symbol of the nation, a culture that has flourished and is evident in the transmission of knowledge through generations, the footprints of culture that remain, and the equal expansion.
Minor cultures are often lost without leaving any relevant historical records and are not recognized as a suitable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states established a central government in a rough form, first under the Articles of Confederation, with a unicameral Congress.
The Congress has no authority to impose taxes, and since there is no national administration or judiciary, it has to rely on state agencies, which often fail to cooperate in enforcing all actions of the Congress.
Furthermore, the Congress does not yet have the power to repeal tax laws and customs duties between the various states as well.
The law has to be unanimously approved by all states before it can be amended, and the states hardly pay much attention to the central government, let alone the representatives of each state who rarely attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are ranked as the second most successful teams in the world, and both have been FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern region, with many Italians participating in international and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honsyu is the largest island) resulting in Japan being the seventh-largest island nation in the world!
Due to the area in Japan being filled with groups or archipelagos, Japan is often referred to by its geographical characteristics as "archipelago".
Taiwan was born in the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the name of this island as Ilha Formosa or the Beautiful Island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing new methods of producing grains and hiring Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western coastal area and the northern coastal area of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), in 1895 the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki to cede sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, making Japan govern the island until 1945.
Visit Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca civilization, comprising three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most buildings in the area around the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists the opportunity to see what they were originally like.
In 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu ruins had been restored, and restoration work continued to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format found in the world is 35mm, which was a key film size in the late era of analog film.
Currently, this type of film is still being produced, but the more important issue is the image-to-picture ratio that is passed on from the digital camera's image censoring pattern.
In reality, the 35mm format, which is 33mm wide and 24mm high, is somewhat confusing.
The ratio of this type (divided by 12 to become the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3: 2.
Various general forms (such as those in the APS family, etc.) are approximately equal to or comparable to the ratio of this image.
The three-part rule that is often heavily criticized and frequently ridiculed is a simple approach to creating dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
It is specified that the most efficient position for the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts in both the vertical and horizontal directions (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was prosperous and powerful, was thoroughly scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has linked various states in Europe together, despite differences in language and tradition.
The power that spreads out affects every group, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the key principles of Christianity is that one should use wealth to alleviate suffering and desperate poverty, and the church's funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this has been followed in practice.
Not long after the war broke out, the English blocked Germany's maritime communication routes.
It has been proven that this strategy is effective in causing a significant shortage of military supplies and civilian supplies, even though such a blockade would violate international law, which is generally accepted and compiled by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The British laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering various parts of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this approach, Germany expected a response similar to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries sought peace and independence.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of World War I, nations therefore did not want such a situation to occur again in the future.
In the year 1884, Tesla moved his base to the United States to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with $4 in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his manager from a previous engagement) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time, dividing them into distinct periods or dynasties, each with its own special characteristics.
During the periods between each dynasty, the various provinces, which were separate from one another, lacked stability. The most well-known period is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
A fierce war broke out among many nobles who fought to seize the throne during this period.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for power in the imperial palace at Chang'an.
Social and political impacts are numerous, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from an absolute monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
After the revolution, various professions are still open to all male applicants as well, providing opportunities for those who are ambitious and want to achieve the greatest success to achieve it.
Just like the military, it is the same, because instead of appointing ranks according to social status, they appoint according to the size of the barrel.
In addition, the French Revolution also inspired the working class, which was oppressed in other countries, to start their own revolutions to some extent.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond ordinary life. He often went to a cave known as "Hira'" on Mount Nur (Light) to meditate frequently.
The cave, which has survived through time, vividly depicts a leaning towards the subject of the spirit.
This cave is situated on one mountain peak that is located north of Megakat and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy at all to find it, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, it's like being completely cut off from the outside world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky above and numerous mountains surrounding it, there is nothing else to see. It's almost impossible to see or hear anything from this world when you are inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exist today.
The great pyramid built by the Egyptians in the 3rd millennium BC is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or "Great Necropolis of Giza," is located in the Valley of the Kings of the Egyptians and consists of numerous pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
A large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "bohangy" symbol resembles a V shape. The "bow upside down" symbol resembles a paper sewing pattern or a square shape with no bottom.
Meaning "to lift" means you should start at the end of the reins then lift the reins, and meaning "to lower" means you should start at the part where the reins are held (the position where your hand is gripping the reins) then lower the reins.
Normally, a violin bow stroke upwards produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke produces a more powerful and resonant sound.
You can draw your own marks, but remember that printed musical accidentals are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected normally.
The timid King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, were forced by a mob of market women to leave Versailles and return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that jeered and intimidated the king and queen.
The crowd pressed the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open at all times.
At one point, one of the crowd members swayed the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in the face of a terrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay for the cost of war to conquer the Philippines for the American imperialist empire.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to deduct most of the costs and interest from the bonds held in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
It is obvious that the high profits resulting from the long-standing exploitation of the Philippines by the Filipinos will be considered a basic benefit of the imperialism of the United States.
To understand the Paris Agreement, we need to understand the context that triggered its establishment.
The era in which this event occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 1000-1300) of European history.
The High Middle Ages was the period following the Early Middle Ages and preceding the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
The definition of technology direction is a comprehensive term that encompasses a wide range of concepts that are put into practice, from pushing technology or technological necessity to the precise meaning that the fate of humanity is driven by basic logic related to scientific rules and expressed in the form of technology.
For the most part, technological positivism has two general concepts in common, namely that technology develops along a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology imposes a "natural" impact on society rather than one that is socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car leads to the development of roads inevitably (1)
However, the national highway network will not be economically viable if only a few cars are in use. Therefore, a new production method has been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
In addition, the fact that car owners have a multitude of vehicles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the road, which in turn has led to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged bodywork.
Romanticism has a majority of its components as a cultural phenomenon, which was received from many writers, such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and as time passes, traditions and cultures related to geography emerge, and these, which are in harmony with the place of society, are better than laws established without principles.
Constantinople is regarded as the fashion capital of the feudal Europe, much like Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the modern world.
The reputation as a center of luxury began around the 4th century and continued until around the 11th century.
This place experienced a decline in status during the 12th century, primarily due to the Crusaders returning gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, there was a change in the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its highest popularity between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the early period, attire was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the slow communication channels make Western styles lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans began to develop their own styles. One of the greatest developments of that time was the Crusaders' use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming that is carried out to produce food just enough to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system that often involves organic farming using seeds grown in a specific ecological zone combined with crop rotation or simple techniques such as others to increase productivity.
Historically, most farmers have worked as a means of livelihood and still do so in many developing countries.
Subculture gathers individuals with similar thought patterns who feel overlooked by social norms, then helps them develop a sense of self-awareness.
Subcultures may have clear differences due to age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
Characteristics such as those that define a subculture may be linguistically, aesthetically, religiously, politically, sexually, geographically, or otherwise distinct.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive styles that are specific symbols, such as fashion, mannerisms, and jargon, etc.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to utilize the case of unfortunate children who are abandoned, impoverished, or become victims of intentional abuse and do not receive socialization from adults as they grow up.
This type of child is called "radicals" or "generation" children. Some radical children are locked up by people (usually their own parents) and in some cases, children are abandoned due to the parents' inability to cope with the child's mental or physical disabilities.
Children who have grown up in the wild may have had a severely traumatic experience at a young age or have emotional scars before being abandoned or running away.
Others are mentioned as being raised by animals, while some claim to live in the forest by themselves.
When raised thoroughly by non-human animals, a child living in a state similar to that of a wild animal will exhibit behavior (within physical constraints) almost entirely like that of the caretaking animal, such as being fearful or uninterested in humans.
Although learning through projects may make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding instruction does even more.
Scavenging is not a method of learning, but rather a tool to support individuals who are learning new things, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scavenger can be either virtual or physical, such as a teacher being one form of scavenger, but a small paper clip in Microsoft Office is also a scavenger, just like that.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated within the software itself and are designed to pose questions, stimulate, and explain steps that students may struggle to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, from being abandoned to being abused, or even forced into servitude.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that does not provide care, empathy, and knowledge, but they have grown up in that environment.
We understand that the family sponsorship system is a safe haven for these children.
Our family support system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and trustworthy healthcare.
Caregiving should prepare all necessary items that are missing or defective from the home where the child previously lived.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction methods.
For example, "learning" and "socialising" are considered to be major motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995)
When they examined the reactions of viewers towards the website, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also pointed out that "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" are new motivations.
The use of video recordings has led to a significant discovery regarding the interpretation of facial expressions in a fleeting moment, which is a movement of the face in a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is claimed that humans can detect whether one person is lying or not by interpreting a slight facial expression correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggested in his research titled "On the Language of Presidents" that people who are unable to understand spoken words due to brain trauma can still assess sincerity somehow.
He repeatedly points out that there may be certain animal species, such as domestic dogs, that possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior as well.
Research in the 20th century indicated that there are entirely two genetic changes, namely the non-expressing group and the expressing group.
Mutations have increased genetic diversity, and the process of selection has removed those from the expressed diversity group.
Separation and recombination change forms back and forth between the two generations.
In a savannah, mammals with a digestive system similar to humans will respond to the demand for amino acids from scarce plant resources.
In addition, the inability to do so may also lead to severe consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would likely be proteins that are accessible in leaves and legume family plants, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, cockroaches, eggs) not only are easy to digest, but also provide protein with all essential amino acids in high quantities.
It's hardly surprising when considering everything, if our ancestors were to solve the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimps in the savannah do it today.
The sleep-wake cycle interruption is a process of waking up intentionally at your normal sleep time and falling asleep again after a short period of time (10 - 60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using an alarm clock that doesn't ring too loudly to wake you up, making you feel awake without being fully alert.
If you often tend to roll over and hit the snooze button while sleeping, you can place the alarm clock far away on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large quantities of liquid (especially water or tea known to be diuretics) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that an individual possesses will be inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The more one feels at ease, the more positive vitality will increase. Every person has the potential to truly find peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can be aware. The only obstacle to this goal is our own stress and negative outlook.
Buddhism in Tibet has its roots in the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been augmented by the Mahayana approach and numerous yogic techniques from India.
In principle, Buddhism in Tibet is very simple, consisting of the cultivation of the four immeasurables, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness that envelops all things.
Kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (the energy of awareness) through the practice of yoga, breathwork, mantra, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan-style meditation is the deity yoga. The channel of energy is cleansed, the channels are made to work, and awareness is achieved through the creation of images of various deities.
Germany was a common enemy of the Soviet Union and the United States in World War 2, which led to cooperation between the two countries. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and cultures caused friction between various countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies turned into enemies, and the Cold War then began.
It will continue for another 40 years ahead and there will be a real fight by the army of representatives in various battlefields from Africa to Asia in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive forces collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were soon outdated as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern territories of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, a treaty that prohibited aggression between the Soviet Union and Poland, as well as other treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is the most efficient method for transferring large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Originally, the role of the navy was to ensure that its country could maintain the ability to move people and goods, while also hindering the ability of the enemy to do the same.
One notable example in recent times is the Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which American forces attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to provide aid to the English.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used U-boats, attempted to halt this transportation.
If the Allied forces fail, Germany might be able to conquer England, as it has already successfully occupied the rest of Europe.
It appears that sheep were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to gain easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Generally, goats raised are kept in enclosures that are moved around on hills or in other grazing areas, similar to the more widely known method of raising sheep. Goats are often raised by children or young people, and this method of herding animals is still used today.
The canal was built in England in the 16th century.
Although the cart had only two parallel boards, it allowed the horse-drawn cart to increase speed and pull heavier loads than on slightly more rugged roads at that time.
Tracks were initially laid with wooden sleepers to be placed relatively quickly. However, it was later realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had steel on top.
This became a common practice, but iron made the wooden wheels of the carts wear out even more than before.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels, and in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time entirely.
The first known method of human transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright around 2 million years ago, along with the emergence of Homo Erectus (Homo Erectus means upright human).
Australopithecus, their ancestor, did not walk upright as a normal manner.
Bipedal animals were found to be expertly walking on two legs in the fossil record of the Australian marsupial, Ostracodektes, dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle by joining environmental movements and even becoming activists ourselves to some extent, in order to alleviate some of the hardships that will be faced in the future.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear enough that the world has undergone significant changes due to the progress of human science and technology, and various problems have increased due to an excessive population and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, which had been signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary of the Congress, was then sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, just a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, around 150 to 200 copies were created, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadside".
John Nixson first read this document to the public at Independence Mall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving pages of the Declaration of Independence are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call those dinosaurs birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have fur and can fly.
There are many songs that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and claws. They lay eggs and walk on their hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus.
Most computers in use today rely on data management, which is written in the form of binary code.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits in a specific computer terminology.
Internal poison may not appear immediately. Various symptoms such as vomiting are common symptoms that cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator that there has been ingestion of poison may be the presence of a container of toxic medication or household chemicals that are open.
Check the label to see specific first aid instructions for that poison.
Entomologists formally refer to this group of insects as beetles.
This word comes from being familiar with boats since ancient times, when boats were like adaptable insects that could live on the human body.
Both the caterpillar and the butterfly are creatures that cannot reproduce on their own when they hatch. They have to adapt to living in a nest or the habitat of their caregiver.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 people suffering from multiple sclerosis (or MS), making it the top country for neurological disorders in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
The couple decided that raising a baby is not something they or their child need.
These couples may choose to have a child by adopting a child.
To adopt a child, a biological parent surrenders their right to raise their child, allowing another married couple to raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to find the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is a working approach for almost all scientific research.
However, it's not just one thing. Experimentation and testing are a form of verification used to eliminate at least one possible hypothesis by asking questions and observation is also a research approach in science as well.
Naturalists and philosophers are interested in ancient Greek and Roman texts, and particularly the Latin Bible.
The perspective of Aristotle is accepted in every branch of science, including psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the Western world found itself severed from the philosophical and scientific roots of the Greeks.
There are many different rhythms in biological mechanisms and behaviors that are often observed, which typically depend on the presence of cycles within the body and the operation through biological clocks of those cycles.
Rhythms that occur in intervals (which are not just responses to periodic external signals) have been recorded to exist in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an autonomous oscillator that continues to work independently, even without external guidance.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is a crucial clue that indicates DNA is a genetic material.
Herchey and Ches used a phage or virus to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, identifying DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or identifying proteins of phage with radioactive radium.
The effects of mutation are diverse, depending on the type of mutation, the key characteristics of the affected genetic segment, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell or not.
Only genetic mutations in cells that are passed on genetically are able to be passed down to offspring, while other mutations may cause cells to die or become cancerous cells.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of activities in a location include hunting, fishing, taking photos, birdwatching, and touring a garden, as well as studying information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutangs on the island of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of a small town in the countryside to go to work, in contrast to those who are heading to work at a place they have just arrived at.
In public transportation with a lot of traffic, everyone is involved or supports travel by private car in one way or another.
Science currently indicates that this massive carbon-using economic system has caused the Earth's surface and atmosphere, where living beings exist, to lose balance that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In a developed country, you would hardly hear a complaint of this level about the quality of water or a bridge that collapses.
Why does the transportation system lead to complaints like this? Why does an error occur every day? Is it because the engineers of the transportation system lack ability, or is it something as basic as that?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of one driver and vehicle between two points and the interactions between the two parties.
It's unfortunate that the study of traffic fluidity is a difficult matter, due to the unpredictable behavior of drivers, which can be forecasted with 100% certainty.
It's fortunate that drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner. The flow of traffic is likely to be fairly consistent, making it possible to approximate its value mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, three key characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects are the first type of animal to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators more easily and find food and a mate more efficiently.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings along the length of their body.
Help them have more diverse small places to hide from hunters.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are the cicada and the white ant.
Many centuries ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people agree with his idea, but many others believe in the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars) moves around the Earth.
It makes sense, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving at all, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river and the largest river in the world, with a volume of water eight times greater than the second-largest river.
In addition, the Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with some sections being as wide as six miles.
20 percent of the world's rivers flow into the ocean, and that 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is the confluence of waters from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, the size and technical excellence of the Great Pyramids of Giza still stand out.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished to see the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800 people, making it the smallest and least populous sovereign state in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communication.
Most people working in the state use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical components such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in their original form in nature and are relatively easily extracted with various prehistoric tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is composed of at least one of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the state of the four substances more than (in the same order) which are solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas, but he also theorized that they will change into a new substance to form what we see.
Generally, an alloy is a mixture of two or more kinds of metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Various elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, which is certainly true for metals like gold and silver as well.
In addition, you may have an alloy with non-metallic components, such as carbon, mixed in small quantities.
Everything in the universe is formed from matter, and all matter is formed from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that a billion billion atoms can be packed into a single point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils are friendly to many people when they are put on the market.
It's sad that when new writing methods keep emerging, pencils are gradually losing their importance and usage.
People today can write messages on a computer screen without having to get close to a pen at all.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's similar to carrying a heavy load up a mountain. Separating the nucleus again will release that energy to some extent.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are likely to split apart with even the slightest vibration, or may not vibrate at all.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.
The shell on the near side is approximately 70 km. The shell on the far side is approximately 100 km.
The moon's crust is thinner in the maria (seas) regions but thicker in the highland areas.
The side closer to the surface may have more maria because it has a thinner crust, making lava shoot up to the surface more easily.
The theoretical content focuses on searching for what makes people choose or be interested.
These theories show that people have some sort of desire, and/or need, which arises while they grow up to be adults.
These theories consider what it is that makes some people want to do something they have done, and what it is in their environment that will make them do or not do something.
The two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, there may be two behaviors that occur when a manager brings in someone who used to be a coworker. One is trying to be "part of them" (or her).
This type of manager has problems with unpopular decisions, disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and controlling personal accountability.
On the contrary, one person becomes someone who can't remember, feeling that he or she has to change everything the team has done all along and make it their own.
Regardless of the outcome, the leader must take responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to a sense of unease between the leaders and everyone else on the team.
Virtual teams have standards of excellence similar to traditional teams in general, but with significant differences.
Team members often act as a contact point for close-knit physical groups.
They often have self-made team members rather than those following the original model, as their team may meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by local administrators.
Having a "phantom team" in reality (Larson and LaFosse, 1989, p. 109) is also a specific component of the virtual team.
"The Phantom Team" is an administrative team where every member has to report. The Phantom Team will set standards for each member.
Why one organization would want to go through the process of establishing a learning organization, which takes a long time, is one of the goals in implementing the concept of organizational learning, namely innovation.
When all resources are utilized effectively across departments performing various functions within the organization, creative thinking and smartness can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new process that is more innovative in responding to customer needs.
Before an organization can have an idea, leadership must create a culture of innovation alongside sharing knowledge and learning within the organization.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach is a method for achieving high organizational effectiveness.
Neurophysiological data provides key evidence for physical research on the theoretical process of perception, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more accurate.
The relationship between neurological disorders and behavior will help scientists in their research.
It has been well known for a long time that various types of brain damage, including injuries, lesions, and tumors, have an impact on behavior and cause some changes in mental functioning.
The increasing availability of new technologies helps us see and inspect the overall structure as well as the working processes of the brain in areas that were previously unseen.
This gives us a wealth of information and content to create scenario models, which help us understand the processes in the mind.
Although AI has a clear undertone to science fiction novels, AI is a crucial branch of computer science that deals with the management, learning, and smart adaptation of machine behavior.
Research on AI is related to making machines perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling capabilities, as well as the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, including hand-writing recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate fields of study, each focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are often used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in software applications for home computers and various video games.
Field trips are a crucial part of every class. Often, a teacher will take their students to various locations that cannot be reached by public transportation.
Technology presents a solution to problems through virtual field trips. Students can view inventions in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting with others in the classroom.
Sharing virtual field trip experiences is a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future learning.
For example, students from Bennett High School in North Carolina designed a travel website for their state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but older versions are still available online to be viewed as scrapbooks.
The blog can also help improve a student's writing by providing feedback. Although students often start their blogging experience with grammatical errors and misspellings, having an audience generally helps correct those mistakes.
Because students are often the most important group of readers, bloggers have started to heavily revise their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "pushes students to understand the world around them more." In addition, the need to respond to the interests of readers inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and promotes students to learn more beyond regular class hours.
Appropriate use of blogs can promote children to analyze and criticize more, help students to determine their positions in the context of others' writing through enthusiastic responses to online content, as well as summarize their own perspectives on specific issues (Orahevich, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada, rich in history and lined with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south is the Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and others.
These things and others make Ontario stand out, becoming the heart of Canada in the eyes of outsiders.
A large area located far to the north has a relatively scattered population, and some areas are so deserted that almost no people inhabit them.
The comparison of population numbers that has surprised many is that the number of American citizens of African descent living in the United States is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
It has Madagascar as its largest island, so large that it can be considered a continent in itself, especially when it comes to flora and fauna.
Small islands are mostly independent nations or have a connection with France and are known as luxury resorts by the sea.
In addition, Arabs also brought Islam to various lands and gained great popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, found a route through various islands from Europe to India.
The northern area borders with the Sahel region, while the southern and western areas border the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I recommend that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring would be beneficial (but not one that's too expensive)
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead them to think it's harassment and it's not uncommon to be grabbed, etc.
Stand firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up (whether there are cultural differences or not, it's not something that's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used it as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco built this city anew, calling it Daru l-Badya, and the merchants from Spain, who established their trading base here, named it Casablanca.
Gazelle is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan shops, such as tanneries, pottery, leather goods, henna, and many other miscellaneous items. But all of these are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the easternmost point, close to Rwanda.
In the year 2545, the town of Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, causing most of the town's roads to be buried under volcanic ash, especially in the central part of the town.
Despite having a relatively safe environment, if you plan to travel outside of Goma city, it is advisable to research beforehand to understand the prolonged conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is still a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as the best gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) at a regular local price of around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
When combined with the difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation making it a tourist destination with an airport as well.
In the year 2533, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of sandstorms in the desert.
Here it is:
This city is vastly different from other cities in the country, due to its distinctly Arab atmosphere, rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is situated in the northeastern part of South Africa, parallel to the border of Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border abutting the Crocodile River.
This park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting a unique variety of wildlife.
Here is the translation:
Daily conservation fees and entrance fees are collected, just like in other national parks in South Africa.
In addition, if anyone buys a Wild Card ticket, it might be more cost-effective because they can visit national parks in South Africa everywhere, which can choose to visit just some or all of them as desired (1).
Hong Kong Island makes the Hong Kong territory famous, and it is also a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The building that lines up to form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a brightly lit bar chart, with the Victoria Harbour water serving as a clear backdrop.
If you want to see the best view of Hong Kong, then get off the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite shore.
The rapid development of most cities on the Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the northern coastal area that has been reclaimed.
This is a place that the English colonizers occupied as their own. Therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the history of this colony, then this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching about 80 km (50 miles) into the delta region of Bangladesh and India, which is far from the coast.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated Sundarbans as a World Heritage Site, as part of the Sundarbans forest reserve located in the border of India, known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just limited to mangrove forests. There are also remnants of large forests that once covered the Ganges River delta.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is covered by water/area that is a wetland.
Sundarban is a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in this area currently.
Buses depart from the inter-state bus station (across the river) throughout the day, with the majority of buses heading eastbound departing from the station between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to buy tickets in advance for two or three days in advance, as buses between zones are often fully booked.
In most areas, there are small Japanese-style buses called "Kosetsu" which are comfortable and stable, providing service.
The same taxi route is a convenient and quick way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 km) and Punakha (200 km).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese town of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers rise to an astonishing height of 83 meters. They are 378 meters long and consist of two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge is 15 meters high above the ground. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for use until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important group of indigenous peoples who inhabit the eastern Paraguay region, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunter-gatherers and farmers.
The Chaco region was once the habitat of other indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing together.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the confrontation between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the creators of a long-lasting colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has preserved many characteristics and indigenous identities.
Argentina is renowned for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year was held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
You can watch smaller tournaments and competitions here at other times of the year.
For various news and information regarding the polo competition and ticket purchasing locations, please check at Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency used in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which has a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at only one bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FCI West.
Generally, you can use English pounds everywhere on this island, including using a Stanley credit card, and US dollars are also widely accepted.
It may be possible that outer islands do not accept credit cards, even if they accept English and US dollars. Check with the owner in advance to determine the acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange currency outside the Falkland Islands, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, in the time when the Northern Hemisphere is winter, it is summer there, and in the time when the Northern Hemisphere is summer, it is winter there.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region. In the months that fall within the summer season, temperatures above 30°C are considered normal.
Winter may be colder than expected, meaning the temperature itself barely drops below freezing point, but it feels colder than the thermometer says due to wind and humidity.
There is no distinct "rainy season" and "dry season" in particular, with precipitation levels being relatively consistent throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, nonetheless wild animals are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials announced that one must stay at least 100 yards or meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards or meters away from all other wildlife.
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, musk deer, elk, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, over a hundred people are injured due to inadequate social distancing. These animals are large, ferocious, and potentially hazardous, so they need to be kept at a safe distance.
In addition, please note that various scents will attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing strong-smelling food and always keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the country's official capital since 1959.
This port is the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence that the Moa movement established, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the movement's supreme leader.
There are numerous beaches due to Oamaru having two harbours, one on each side of the town. The most popular beach is located in three areas.
North Shore (in the North Shore District) lies on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These beaches are beaches full of sand that can be swum in safely almost all of them, and most of them are shaded by the leaves of the Pōhutukawa tree.
Tamaki Drive is located at the Whangaparāoa Bay in the affluent suburban area of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Sometimes these beaches are family beaches that are crowded with people and have shops lined up along the coast. The swimming area is safe.
The leading local beer brand is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer but has a pleasant taste and a refreshing feel. Another local beer brand is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you shouldn't miss, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more suitable for travel.
Tap water in the local area is safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, a 'flat white' is a strange thing, while a short black is an 'espresso'. A cappuccino must be topped with a large dollop (not a foam) and that is served without milk.
Chocolate is considered Belgian standard, but the fruit juice is expensive but tastes very good.
Throughout the year, there have been numerous diving trips to the coral reef and not many injuries have been found to be caused by these incidents at the coral reef.
However, please seek advice from officials, follow every sign, and give top priority to safety warnings.
