This is called a chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator to make a pH indicator.
The color of the juice of a tomato changes based on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, as indicated by pH, is what pH measures.
Hydrogen ions are those protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).

From the ground itself, the smell itself, from the very beginning, the hyenas pursue and find animals (prey) for the purpose of eating, say scientists who are worried.
They have eyes that are clearly visible even in the sand, and they move in a way that is not noticed by anyone. Like osilates, they are seen nowhere in their surrounding area and then suddenly jump onto their prey.
Small populations of birds, when they are separated from their main group (as easily as crossing a mountain range, or a river, or once landing on a new island) they find that the environment they are in is completely different from what they were used to.
This new environment has diverse sources and diverse competitors, hence, for the new population, it is necessary to have diverse characteristics or adaptability.
The population remains unchanged, and they still need the transformations as before.
In the aftermath, the newcomers begin to adapt to their new environment, looking at the other community with a great deal of distrust.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two societies are seen as distinct, hence they are not called as one species.
We call this process transmutation, the formation of new transmutations being its meaning. Transmutation is an involuntary process and a major part of development.
Humans exhale oxygen, and plants produce it, and they absorb carbon dioxide (i.e., inhalation and exhalation).
Plants produce food through photosynthesis from the sun and also provide shade.
We make our homes from trees and our clothes from wood products. Most of the food we consume are plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaur was the most ferocious animal of its time, hence it did not tremble at the sight of any other Mosasaur.

If you watched the National Treasure movie, you might think that the map of the treasure was written before the declaration of independence.
Despite that, it's not true. There's nothing written on the back of that letter, but it looks like a map of a tomb.
The Declaration of Independence was captioned on the reverse as "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document.
Though we do not know who wrote this, we know that in the days it was prepared, this large skin parchment (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and hung.
Therefore, there is a possibility of adding a simple note in the form of a label.
The D-Day landings and the next wars were open to the north of France, but the south was not yet independent.

In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated Southern France, marching towards Germany.
Civilization is shared through a notable large group of people living and working together as one culture, by the cooperation of one society.
The term 'Nagarika' is derived from the Latin word 'Civilis', which refers to citizens or civil people, and 'Civitas', meaning city or state, and collectively refers to a society.
Cities are the precursors to states. A well-cultivated culture spreads its knowledge to the next several generations, which is a lasting legacy of the culture and is considered a good dissemination.
Historical evidence is lost due to the lack of connection with the small cultures, and they are not identified as civilizations.
During the time of the Revolutionary War, thirteen states joined together under the principles of the Articles of Confederation to form the first weak central government – Congress was its sole component.
There was no power to levy any taxes, and, there was no national executive, judiciary, as a result of which, it was dependent on the state officials, but they were generally uncooperative in implementing all its directives.
Laws and duties related to taxes between states and the authority to override them should not exist.
Articles required unanimous consent from all states before amendment and the states took as much liberty from the Centre as their representatives were generally absent from the sessions.

Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (Honsu is the largest) and is the world's 7th largest island-holding country!
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to the presence of hundreds of island groups.
The origins of Taiwan, in the 15th century, when sailors passed by this island, they called it Ilha Formosa or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the indigenous agricultural production methods, and hired Chinese laborers to work in its sugar and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) secured control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing dynasty declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, thereby ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main forms in the Machu Picchu, which are, Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The facades of the original buildings are seen in good imagination for tourists, so many buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, about thirty percent of the Machu Picchu ruins had been rebuilt, and the rebuilding continues.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the size of movie screens at the end of the era of film cameras.
It is produced to this day, although its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor forms.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit ambiguous, a 36mm width with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format, simplified to a whole number ratio by dividing by thirteen, is said to be 3:2.
Many common forms (APS sequence forms) are equal to or approximate this shape to this proportion.
The third most misused and always derogatory rule, is a simple rule of thumb, that keeps the order of a picture.
According to its nature, a film's main subject's most impactful place is where the lines of division between the three parts of the film, when divided vertically and horizontally, intersect.
At this time in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For nearly a thousand years, Christianity held on to Europe's states, despite their linguistic and cultural diversity.
His omnipresent power spread from the king to the common man.
One of the primary aspects of Christian doctrine is the use of wealth to alleviate poverty and provide aid to those in distress, which is the same purpose of the collection of Church funds.
The central authority of the discussion has been established in Rome for several thousand years, and the concentration of this authority and money is the cause of numerous questions as to whether it is managed by this doctrine.
Britain initiated a ban on Germany, as if a crisis situation had arisen.
The effectiveness of this tactic has been proven, but it violates the internationally accepted law that has been agreed upon by everyone over the past two centuries through numerous international agreements.
Britain conducted a survey in the international waters, causing danger to both moving and stationary ships.
Due to the limited response to this method, Germany is expecting a similar response to its uncontrolled neutron bomb.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and separatism.

In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived at the station, all he had with him was 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bacheler (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system of time; each dynasty or period of rule was a distinct royal clan.
Each dynasty was marked by an unstable era of provinces. For 60 years, the Han and Jin dynasties were known for the instability between the three provinces.
In this period, a series of brutal wars were fought between many emperors for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period in ancient Chinese history was one of the most brutal eras, with countless lives lost as people fought for the throne, including the extravagant palace of Xian, where countless people lost their lives in the struggle for the highest seat.
There are numerous social and political influences here, namely the use of the metric system, the fact that it became a democracy in reality, a shift towards nationalism, and the notion that the country was no longer ruled by a single monarch.
After the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, and this facilitated the achievement of success by the most ambitious and successful men.

The French Revolution inspired people from the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
He was deeply fascinated by this worldly life. Often, he would observe a cave as "Nur" (light) and a mountain as "Hira" (fire) on Mount Paran.
In that time, Muhammad himself survived the cave, giving us a picture of his spiritual inclinations.
The cave located atop the mountains of the north of Mecca is distinct from the rest of the world.
In reality, it exists for anyone, even if you know it's there, it's a bit of a challenge to find it. Once you're in a cave, it gives you a feeling of complete solitude.
The crystal-clear, beautiful cave and the surrounding mountain ridges are nowhere to be seen. One can see or hear a small part of this world from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, even today, is one of the seven wonders of architectural designs.
In the 3rd century BC, the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid, which was constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh, and it is one of many large pyramid structures built.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" at the edge of the Egyptian desert is home to numerous pyramids (among them the Great Pyramid is the largest), small mounds, temples and large statues.
A large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous small pyramids, obelisks, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's family and relatives.

One of the crowd, a man threw the head of the Royal Guard, who had been struck with fear, into the face of the Queen.
The Philippines was literally paid for by the Filipinos themselves as the cost of the war of Imperial America.
The burden of paying taxes to the US colonial administration was imposed on them, and interest was charged on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Despite this, the Philippines' long-term subjugation brought the most benefits to the American imperialist ideology.
Before we understand the meaning of Temples, we need to understand the sequence of its creation.
The period of events is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The Middle Ages was in a state of ascension, spanning from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, and it ended around 1500 through a process of transformation.
Technological Determinism is held up by technological push or the technological imperative from the scientific laws to which they are related in the expression of their logic and technology in human handwriting until the meaning of a strict definition is reached, encompassing a wide range of questions.
Technical determinism's most interpretations share two common concerns, namely: that technological development is largely guided by cultural or political influence, and that technology imposes "consequences" on societies that are more internally determined than socially regulated.
For instance, one can say that individual car owners themselves are the primary cause for the development of roads.
Despite this, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for just a handful of cars, so in order to reduce the cost of car ownership, new production methods have been developed.
The ownership of a large number of cars has led to an increase in road accidents, which in turn has led to the invention of new health technologies to repair damaged bodies.
It was largely romanticized by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped personalities, and subsequently, practices and cultures related to that geography emerged, which harmonized with the social status, and were better than the uncontrolled laws imposed upon them.
Paris is called the capital of the contemporary world's fashion in the same way that Constantinople was considered the capital of Europe's fashion.
Around 400 BCE, and up to 1100 CE, it was known as the centre of Shaivism.
Byzantine markets were surpassed by more valuable gifts such as silk and spices, mainly because of the return of the practitioners of religion in the 14th century.
At the same time, the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Between the 10th and 14th centuries, the Gothic style reached its zenith.
At the beginning, the garment was heavily bound by the Byzantine tradition in a large measure.
However, due to slow communication methods, the lifestyle of the Western Frontier may be lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the religious wars, people started using guns to wear clothes, which was one of the greatest developments of that time.
Agriculture is carried out by farmers and their families just to meet their necessities, producing food.
Sustainable agriculture means a simple, eco-friendly method that uses the maximum possible crop rotation or the same simple techniques such as local seed collection from environmentally friendly sources.
Historically, many farmers had adopted farming as a means of livelihood, and it still exists in many developing countries.
Cultural norms tend to overlook individuals with equal minds and facilitate the development of a sense of identity.
Membership, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender information may lead to the specialisation of subcultures.
The characteristics that determine something to be a subculture are language, beauty, religion, politics, sexuality, geographical location or elements combined.
Members of subculture typically signify their membership in a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes ornaments, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to depict some uncertain circumstances of children growing up from adults, being introduced to social life, being forced into oppression, or being neglected or unfortunate.
Such a person is called a pest or a nuisance. Some of the nuisance children are deliberately kept away by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the parents reject the child's severe intellectual or physical disability, and that child grows up in this way.
Children who are abandoned or run away may experience severe physical abuse or corporal injury before being abandoned.
It is assumed that others are made from animals; some were themselves forest dwellers.
When completely made from non-human animals, the animal's specific traits are as much as possible displayed (within its physical limits), that is, it has traits such as frightening humans or making them feel disgusted.
Plan-based learning makes learning easier, just like taking one step forward and making it more interesting, turning a concept into a scaffold (scalloping).
The concept of scaffolding (scapholding) is not just a teaching technique, but it provides assistance to individuals who are starting a new learning experience or beginning a new project or using a computer program.
The concept of a hypothesis (skafold) may actually exist or may not exist, that is, one teacher may also be a certain type of skafold, just as the small paper clip in Microsoft Office is also a skafold.
The virtual scaffolding in software has been internalized, used to describe a process that is not possible to ask, stimulate, and have students interpret themselves.
Carelessly, neglect, and abuse, among other reasons, children are placed in foster care.
Any child should never grow up in environments that are lacking in nourishment, care, and educational surroundings, yet it happens to them.
We perceive this childcare system as a safety zone for these children.
Our orphanage care system provided safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and trustworthy health services.
All necessities that were lacking in the house he had taken earlier were met by the Foster Care.
The internet, group communication, and communication between individuals combine these two elements.
The use of the diverse features of the Internet and its additional dimensions that provide entertainment.
For example, "Habituation" and "Socialization" have been cited as primary motivations for Internet use (James Et al, 1995).
When websites monitor their audience's responses, "personal involvement" and "advanced relationships" were identified by Igbaria and McKim (1998) as new motivational factors.
Video recording has helped to capture the subtle expressions and facial movements for a few moments at a time, providing a detailed analysis of the nuances.
It has been said that one may discover that a person is lying by accurately interpreting a subtle expression.
Oliver Sacks, in his report "The President's Speech" translates the meaning of a speech into the brain, explains how people who are unable to understand the speech can still measure its authenticity accurately.
Humans exhibit behaviors that are interpreted as being similar to those of domesticated animals, according to them.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic change: the expressed and the non-expressed.
Transformation has been a beacon for new quantitative differences and it brings out the underlying changes from their very source.
Separation and recombination achieves differences between the two groups in each generation.
Filling the amino acid requirements from available plant sources is a very difficult matter for a primate, which has a human-like digestive system.
Besides, failing to do so has grave consequences, namely: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Leafy greens and whole grains are easily obtained from these sources, but for our animal species, cooking these is a challenge.
In contrast, the food of animals (urine, feces, eggs) do not easily digest, but they contain a high proportion of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
After considering all matters, our ancestors would have resolved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees solve theirs, and we would not be astonished.
Sleep Fragmentation means waking up prematurely during a normal sleep time and falling asleep again within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).

In England, there were wagons in the 16th century itself.
The roads were merely a series of parallel wooden planks, yet the carts allowed the wagons to pass, for they were capable of moving at a higher speed and also carrying heavy loads on rough roads.
Tracks were initially introduced with sufficient cross-members. However, the realization dawned that if there was a steel strip on top, the tracks would run more smoothly.
This was a common practice, but iron, the car's wooden wheel spokes were damaged.
Ultimately, the wooden gears were replaced by iron gears. In 1767, the first full iron-wire ropes were introduced.
The first walk was taken, with Homo Erectus (meaning a standing human) alongside humans, who had started walking upright two million years ago.

In developed countries, you rarely hear about water quality or dam collapses.
What is it that the bus system generates, every day, these failures? Are the bus engineers incompetent? Or are there more fundamental issues at play?
Vehicle Dynamics is the study of the interaction between a vehicle and its driver at two points, and their mutual interplay.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a difficult task because the behavior of one driver cannot be estimated with a hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a consistent manner; hence, traffic streams also consist of stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
Traffic flow is well represented by establishing relationships among three primary characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and execution of highway facilities.
The first creatures to fly in the wind are insects. Their ability to fly has made it easy for them to evade enemies, and to search for food and mates more effectively.

People have known about metals like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, which can be found naturally in their natural forms and can be extracted using ancient tools and techniques.
Aristotle, the philosopher, proposed the doctrine that everything in the world is created from one of four fundamental elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is largely about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also proposed that the new substance changes its form to what we see.
Alloys are generally a mixture of two or more metals. There are many aspects in the periodic table that need to be overlooked.

Generally speaking, two behaviors develop into leaders among their peers. This spectrum has one end "like all boys (girls) alike".
It is quite difficult for such a manager to take unpopular decisions, to follow rules and procedures, to evaluate the effectiveness, to assign responsibilities, and to turn people into scapegoats.
Another end of the same spectrum, a team is doing everything, changing to become oneself, thinking that one has to do each of them.
Regardless of the outcome, ultimately the team's loss or victory will be attributed to its leader.
This quality often leads to a rift between the team and its leader.
Wild teams, just like traditional teams, are equally excellent, with a slight difference in levels.
Members of the virtual team operate as an immediate physical group's point of contact.
They generally have more autonomy than members of a standard team, as their teams may meet at different time zones, which may not be meaningful to local management.
