In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments with it.

It confirms not only that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientifically, it is said that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top with a pale or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur lacked a well-developed crest, also known as the rachis, but had other feather-like characteristics - quill knobs and shafts with barbs - researchers inferred that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The four structures suggest they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or insulation. The researchers propose that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the creature shows adult feather patterns and not the downy plumage of a chick.
The researchers suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster shows full-grown feathers and not juvenile down.

The effect they were searching for would be caused by charged particles between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way also exerts an attraction on the Boötes star system.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter affects it.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy cluster is found in a type of radiation halo, and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting is a traditional low-technology experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and then place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate, in an envelope.
After the electoral officer verifies the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' roll.
French electoral legislation has codified these proceedings quite strictly.
Since 1988, voting booths must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there was no ballot box at the beginning of the election and that no ballot box was added except for those that were counted and by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. Voting is done by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

The grenade failed to detonate while aimed at a fifth man's head. Schneider continued to experience pain, blindness in one eye, a missing portion of a skull and a face rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual rides at the Championships.
Her first was the Slalom, where she received the Het Nie Voltooi prize in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in that run.
Her other races, the Giant Slalom, had her qualify in tenth place in the seated women's group with a combined downhill time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place athlete, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to finish in the results.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen scooter and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car made impact, none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son since then.
She is in detention awaiting her indictment and hearing, but any eyewitness evidence may be influenced because her image has been widely published.
This is a general practice among the elderly in the UK, but Scottish legal systems work differently and the publication of the photos is seen as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos of suspects."
Crown Office, which is in overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are laid.
The document, according to the informant, would refer to the border dispute, which, as per Palestine, should be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other subjects that are said to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence only for five years.
Rangers closely monitored the sprays in the supplementary pest control test, as the test was being monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Ski Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were drawn under the Ski Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Observing Director of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected shooters received comprehensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provincial Elections Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were activated by the lack of elections, a party that has been in debt since 2011.
Around 60 cases of unexplained iPod overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said he was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
APPLE last week announced that it had been informed of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company referred to as "non-serious".
The ministry office reacted by calling Apple's display of the report "a real pity".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time, striking (09:19 a.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office has stated that no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has also said that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several survivors have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Early releases were made for some prisoners, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly woman as she had to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to become a midwife and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to do research in his free time on premature births.
Her research has shown that, if hormone is administered, it will accelerate the foetus's lung development.
Xinhua reported that the state's investigation team on Wednesday recovered two 'black box' flight recorders.
People mourners have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first driver Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made a comment that "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even more... in love with her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Out of the 1,400 previous voters from the 2010 federal election, those who stood for Australia to become a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Observant First Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 Percent of those polled share this view, their wish is that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner, Moché, in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games swim, but due to her complaints, her integrity was brought into question.
He couldn't use the medicine he needed to get over his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on a Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of water discharge to the Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth was formed, as comets have collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill that declared same-sex marriages legal.
He referred to it as political gossip and foolishness.
People speculate that he is going to make a run in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually, cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to land the aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is available, and underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-go facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears over a loss in transportation have increased the possibility that the game will be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday has reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species adapted in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, as a result of interbreeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all sorts of shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin thread, which can be spun or twisted. It can be flailed or rolled into a ball.
It can be made very thin and stuck to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using beetroot juice.
The litmus paper changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Rub the two dry powders together and press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The bug on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel strange and form a sort of numbness.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of drainage systems are found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and sight.
It carries a reusable rocket booster over a 100-foot high to place a satellite or telescope in outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable manner. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other vehicles.
Under them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares and antelopes.
In the end, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a great deal more small prey such as insects, rodents, hedgehogs, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Leopards are the most social cats, known to live in large groups called prides.
The colony consists of one to three related males, together with as many as thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leopards creep up trees a lot like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are closely related to leopards (but not to other large cats) in their approach, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the animal can climb (although it's not good), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The animal is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as leopards, lions, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The animal's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a string of piercingly shrieked words.
Small wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds as they can. Almost all the animals that the wild cat hunts are smaller than what they are.
Scientists believe that "oselotte" (game) animals (prey) follow and find by scent. They sniff on the ground to find out where the animals were.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move unseen. Pardel cats hunt their prey by merging with their surroundings and then pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they come (such as when they cross a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will find themselves again in an environment different from that in which they previously were.
The new environment has various resources and other competition, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations as what they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator at the top of its food chain at the time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
She has a long, pointed snout with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of her mouth, meaning there's no way out for anything that crosses her path.
We're not sure, but he could have had a gorged tongue. His diet included shellfish, large fish, mosasaurs, and he could have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked whatever went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be a match for it.
While many of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of exotic or unusual feasts, including wild boar, pheasant, snail, and a type of rodent known as a hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman eat their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men prefer to hold banquets where they lie on their sides and eat their meals.
Ancient Roman feasts could not have included what Europe came to from America, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no maize, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open inner courtyard and then an inner chamber where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top part of the tower was a special holy place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were only open toy boxes that looked out onto the street. Stones were used to build a house with.
There was no great forest in the land of Canaan so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while he continued westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already been living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map written behind the Declaration of Independence.
It's not true at all. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written behind the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one is certain who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, this is possibly that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed, freed northern France, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the "Vichy" French administration. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of baking with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and French forces had freed southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A culture is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, a citizen, and civitas, a city or as in a city, and it also defines the size of the community.
States are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture that passes on knowledge over many generations, a continuing cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures are regularly lost without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to achieve recognition as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with the Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to enforce taxation, and, because there was no national executor or regency, they resorted to the state authorities, which regularly did not want to cooperate, to execute all their acts.
It had no authority to oversee tax laws and rates between states either.
The articles required uniform consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were frequently absent.
Italy's national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winner in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, fastball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic gatherings.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" as a result of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan has been known for centuries, dating back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and referred to the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and introduced a transformation in indigenous grain production practices by Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the slopes of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many general formats (for example, the APS family of formats) is equivalent to or closely approximates this aspect ratio.
The oft-abused and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the crossing of lines that divide the print into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under the searchlight.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite language and cultural differences.
The all-pervading power of it affected everyone; from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically there for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth, has led many to question this premise.
Immediately after the outbreak of unrest, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been effectively proven; it has cut off life-critical military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade generally violating international law by breaking several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The British have a general in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would pose a threat even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany has been expecting a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After they had seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each stage of China or each family in control was a separate dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods of the Three Kingdoms era that took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warring between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; with thousands of people who perished in the struggle for the top seat in the greatest palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler alone.
After the Revolution, positions were also open to male applicants, with the most ambitious and successful being admitted to succeed.
The same money for the military, as the military budget is now based on caliber, rather than on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has long endured, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely and entirely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests on one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In reality, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you're in a cave, it's a complete isolation.
Nothing else but the clean, beautiful air above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plato, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "uphill" mark looks like a V and the "downhill" mark looks like a little crab or a square without its base.
It means you start at the point and press the bow, and off means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a bow stroke in the opposite direction is stronger and more self-sustaining.
Feel free to write your own points, but remember that the printed line markers are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to flee Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a wagon, they returned to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the protesters waves the head of a royal what was killed at Versailles around the frightened Queen.
The war costs of V.S imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines are paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are compelled to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to offset a large portion of the expenditures and the interest on bonds has been driven by the Wall Street bankhouses in the name of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the super profits obtained from the exploited exploitation of the Filipino people would make up the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Temple Dwellers, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological specification is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological print or the technological necessity in a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic paired with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interruptions of technological determinism part two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, yields "effects" on society that are indigenous rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motorcar necessarily led to the development of roads.
A rural road network is, however, not economically viable for just a handful of cars alone, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which again leads to the invention of new technologies in healthcare for the recovery of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were tied to that environment, and these things, which were in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was reckoned as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The fame of it being a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The status had decreased during the 12th century mainly as a result of the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as her and spices, the value of which was higher than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Mode Capital of Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The drag is strongly influenced at the beginning by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West can be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Conservation agriculture is a simple, biannual organisational system that combines preserved seed that is native to the eco-region with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Most farmers are involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of alienation by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop an identity.
Subculture is characteristic due to the members' age, ethnic origin, social status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Leaders of a subculture regularly indicate their membership by a characteristic and symbolic use of style, including modes, manners, and informal language use.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through abandonment, unfavorable circumstances, or deliberate maltreatment, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are referred to as "wild children" or "wild children with a label". Some wild children are locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment can be attributed to parents rejecting a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Wild children may experience serious child abuse or trauma before they are left or run away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some have survived on their own in the wilderness.
When a feral child is completely and utterly raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical bounds) that is almost entirely like that of a particular nurturing animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, stepwork goes a step further.
Steierwerk is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
Both virtual and real can be teachers, in other words, a teacher is a form of teacher but so also the little slide button man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Steiers is in the software and is intended to interrogate, accelerate, and clarify procedures for students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Child Protection for a wide variety of reasons ranging from abandonment, to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and nurturing, but it is a reality.
We see the Child Protection System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe havens, loving caregivers, stable education, and trustworthy healthcare.
Care is assumed to provide all the necessities that were previously taken away in the home.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic traits of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the usage and benefits approach.
For example, "learn" and "socialize" are suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated responses on websites, they identified their "Personal involvement" and "Continued relationship" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly noted that one can infer when a person lies by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his document, The President's Speech, how people who were unable to understand the speech due to brain damage were still able to estimate the sincerity and accuracy of it.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination bring variation back and forth between the two poles of each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available on the savannah.
Further failure to do so will have serious consequences: stifled growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant sources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest, unless it is cooked.
In contrast, insects (such as mealworms, termites, and crickets) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high-quality protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a similar way to how some chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
The wake-up interruption is the process of becoming consciously awake during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to set it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking many fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces a person to wake up so that they can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force that is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breath exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a collective enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and clashes of systems, processes, and culture that led to the countries that fell apart.
Within two years after the end of the war, former allies had become current enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would truly be fought, by standing troops, on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
How it came to be that she had already outdone these plans overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created after they had entered the eastern regions of Poland in contravention of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleet was traditionally to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
In essence, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been very likely to conquer Britain, as it could have conquered the rest of Europe.
Cattle were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold onto them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are commonly found in troops that have wandered over the hills and other grazing areas, and after being rounded up are by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Waspore was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagons were usually made up of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would take to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
A crossbar is relatively early to be taken in to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, it is realised that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron strip at the top.
It has become general practice, but the iron has more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rail was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people stood upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
They, their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back from 4.2 - 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more kindly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat the suffering of the future to some extent.
This is indeed the symptomatic treatment in many cases. How it will be okay, if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is clearly evident enough that the world has changed a lot as a result of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and problems have grown bigger as a result of overpopulation and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After the adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few men to the printing press of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap copies that still exist are known as the oldest surviving copies of the document that still exist. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe today that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with claws and toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and they are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or house of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to contract MS as men.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to make a baby grow.
These parents can choose to set up a savings plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenthood so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations is also scientific research rigorous.
Scholars and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge of Greek was passed down, the West found itself severed from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior is often extremely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are recorded for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, either marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can produce a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are stem-line cells.
Only mutations in the lymph cell can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause the death of cells or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to and studies of information about the ecosystem, in.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn from orangutans and photograph them.
Every morning, people leave the small villages in a car to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area from where they have just left.
In this dynamic pendulum, everyone is connected and supported in one way or another by a transport system based on private motors.
The science indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems breed such complaints, why does it fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more fundamentally at play?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers are on the inside of a reasonably consistent series; and thus the traffic streams have a reasonably consistent nature and can be roughly presented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of high-speed rail facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid their enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage that they are able to fold their wings back onto their body.
It offers them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are the cicadas and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It looks sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
About a full 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
All pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language through many uses that are in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and all of these can be found in their basic form in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, all of which he has a theory that they can change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alluvial deposits that contain small quantities of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles, called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in that point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it ran out.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and usage have decreased as newer writing methods are used.
People are now writing messages on phone screens, and it's not necessary to come near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The Fissie bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like hitting a heavy weight against a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they break apart with a little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the regolith.
The reef is roughly 70km thick at the nearest point and 100 km thick at the far point.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more Maria on the adjacent side because the crust is thinner. This was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is centered around what motivates or satisfies people.
This theory assumes that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is of certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do certain things or not do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge as drivers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to "be one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to enforce disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
The conductor is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior causes a break between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual ranges are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional ranges, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual social gatherings function regularly as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They regularly have more autonomy than conventional squad-based teams as their squads meet at different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible span" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique component of a visual span.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organisation go through such a time-wasting process to establish a learning organisation? One goal of the set of organisational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively throughout the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and wisdom can be uncovered.
As a result, the process of an organisation works together to overcome the obstacle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the client's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study, before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006), has clarified the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve a higher level of work engagement.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it broadens the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, shocks, and wounds affect and in some cases change cognitive functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong connotation with science fiction, Al forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves machine learning to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now regularly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military units, and is also built into various home accounting and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often prefers her students to take a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
To share a virtual excursion is also a good way to reflect on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Online journals can also help improve students' writing skills. While students initially start their online journal entries with crude language use and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journal writer strives for improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging “foresees students becoming more skilled about the world around them.” The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their positions within the context of others' writings, as well as develop their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual, federal capital, featuring a collection of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these things and more mark Ontario as what is seen as quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more Afro-Americans who stay in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the greatest and a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it has taken strong root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it's not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you're dealing with men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to do grocery shopping in the whole of Morocco.
It's easy to find places like the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pastry shops, learning goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of trifles, but it's like for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the central area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside Goma should be carefully considered to understand the ongoing state of conflict in the Northern Kivu province.
The city is also the take-off point to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites that are in danger, due to the dangers of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab flair than that of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting a variety of wildlife species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a "Wild Card" that grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is often compared with a dazzling column graphic, accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development has been packed into reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place where the British colonizers took for themselves and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and stretches 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans is declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The words are not just half-forgotten swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of powerful words that once covered the Gnostic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which roughly one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are approximately 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and departing between 06:30 and 07:30 to Jakar/Bumthang.
As inter-district buses are often fully booked, it is suggested that one buys a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared hire cars is a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as for example Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge. It spans over the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long, with two tracks that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical piers under the bridge are 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational according to schedule in September of 2017, when the Brazilian toll booths are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also applied subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was the home of other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of skirmishes between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, look at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located over Stanley beyond the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted orally on the islands and inside, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars will also be regularly accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and US currencies will be taken; ask the owners in advance to specify what payment methods would be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you exchange money out for you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are general.
The winter can be deceivingly cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing point, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no specific "rainy" and "dry" season: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the nature is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 meters away from bears, wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
It doesn't matter how they appear, buffaloes, impalas, American impalas, deer, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured because they didn't maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware of this that reek bears and other wild life are attracted, so avoid the burning of aromatic food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The village is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious fleet stand in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All the ships are sunk, except for one British warship. Almost 200 American and German lives are required..
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches over two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in the North Head district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Langbaan in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming holes, and most have sheltered coves provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan Beach is on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are some crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The local main beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beers are called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is served with froth on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The warm chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many dives are undertaken to the coral reef throughout the year, and injuries on the coral reef due to any of these causes are scarce.
For now, take advice from authorities, obey all announcements and heed safety warnings.
Butterflies appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can be found on occasion outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles are not truly in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Before booking, give the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, even though you may find it impossible to negotiate other types of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the discussions for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must, however, go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although music may come to an end on the main stages, there may be divisions of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camp areas for families with young children.
When the Northern Baltic region is crossed in winter, make sure of the hut's location, as it causes a great disturbance, for those most affected, to go through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boots the curfew in the village. Passengers of the boat are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximise the amount of money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To keep to their starting point as well as to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication influences your judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone traveling over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing point.
Caution on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you can't drive as if you're on a bare asphalt road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to tie you up.
The windshield may also be limited by falling or wind-driven snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windshields.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris is perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, commonly used, refers to an overland journey to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Party animals, like elephants and camels, tend to gather around the car to come near it and standard equipment will allow good visibility.
Leopards, cheetahs, and lynxes are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A Stapsafari (also known as a "forest step", "loop safari", or go "step") consists of a hike of a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation before the exhibition is announced for 2020, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies for police differ, but from late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
By ironing clothes in a steamy room, they dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if there isn't one in the room.
If a hair straightener is not available or you don't like wearing straightened socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot, (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, be burnt).
There are various methods to purify water, some being more effective against specific threats.
