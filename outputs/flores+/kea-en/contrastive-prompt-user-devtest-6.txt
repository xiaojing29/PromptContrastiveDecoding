The internet combines elements of mass communication of the past with interpersonal communication.
Distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to more dimensions in terms of usage and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learners" and "socialization" will lead to important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuity of relationship were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating reasons of public engagement with websites.

In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate to have a highly similar human system to satisfy its needs for amino acids from available vegetable recurses.
The drought is so severe that we are facing very serious consequences: lack of crops, malnutrition, and even death itself.
Vitamin B12 is easily accessible as a protein in leafy greens and legumes, but it's difficult to get enough from plant-based sources, especially for primates, unless you're supplementing.
In contrast, animal food (ants, cowpeas, eggs) is quite easily digestible, but it does not provide proteins in high quantities that contain all essential amino acids.
In our own time, it's not surprising that our own ancestors revolved around their "protein problems" in the same way that a chimpanzee in the savannah faces today.

It has ten more autonomy than the conventional member of a team, as if the six members can reunite to reach an agreement with a variable hourly schedule that can be understood by the local situation.
A true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the team of each member who at each time provides an account of themselves. The Invisible Team defines rules for each member.

Blogs without a better-written script by students can be of great help to students. However, since students often write their blog posts with dyslexic grammar and spelling, the presentation of a general public is often delayed.
Even if students are almost always publicly more critical, the blog writer takes the effort to improve the written work to avoid criticism.
The blog's slogan is "the students are not obligated to be like everyone else in the world." The public's interest in their food is inspiring students to be unique and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a fantastic thing that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Students can develop their analytical and critical capacity through active responses to online materials; students can define their own puzzles within the context of other people's writings, as well as outline their own perspective on particular issues.
