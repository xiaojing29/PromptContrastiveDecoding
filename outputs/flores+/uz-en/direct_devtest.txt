Medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rodents to antelopes and hares.
There are, of course, a great many small mammals, including, of course, domestic cats, that eat a variety of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of "jo'rtushinchi" - each cat has an equal share, and a special occupation to compete with others.
They are the most social cats living in large groups called colonies.
A pride consists of a male lion, over forty lionesses, and their cubs.
Youth, usually, are the elder brother's or sister's daughters, or the younger sister of the elder brother, closely related to each other.

Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. If possible, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
According to their instincts, ocelots hunt for prey (game) by smelling the animals they run over.
They can see well in the dark with the help of their ability, and they move quietly without making a sound. Ocelots become alert to their surroundings when they are hunting, then they pounce on their prey and catch it.
A small group of existing individuals (a low population) when they separate from the main population (for example, they move up a mountain range or a river or they migrate to a new island because it is easily accessible), they often see themselves in a different environment than they did before.
This new environment is equipped with different resources and competitors, so they will need other characteristics or adjustments to become stronger competitors than they were initially required to be for the new population.
The population is absolutely unchanged, they still need to adapt in the same way as before.
As time passes, the population begins to adapt to its new environment, becoming increasingly less similar to another population.
In the end, after millions of years, the two populations have become so different that they cannot be considered as belonging to the same type.
We call this process the formation of a species, which simply means the formation of new species. The formation of a species is a regular consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, a gas that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, a gas that humans exhale.
Plants produce their own food through photosynthesis from the sun and also reproduce.
We make our houses and clothing from plants. Most of the food we consume comes from plants. Without plants, living beings would not exist.

Civilization is a large group of people living and working together, a common general culture of society.
The word "sivilizatsiya" is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas", which signify a citizen or a city or a city-state, and in some cases, a community, and is derived from the Latin word "civilis" meaning civil or citizen.
Cities-states are the countries' past-relatives. Civilization culture sciences are passed to a few generations, long-lasting cultural traces and fair transmission are considered.
Small cultures are often lost in many cases, leaving behind no historical evidence and are not recognized as a true civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, created a weak central government as part of the Congress.
In Congress, there is no authority to grant tax exemptions, and due to the lack of national enforcement and judicial authority, in most cases, government agencies rely on cooperation rather than mutual assistance.
Together with it, it was not empowered to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
In all states, the introduction of amendments required the approval of all states by a single vote, and since the states' representatives were so easily accepted by the central government, their representatives were often absent.

Japan (approximately 7,000 islands, including the main island of Honshu) is one of the world's seven largest archipelagos.
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago from a geographical point of view, due to the cluster/group of islands.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors passed through, leaving behind the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the local sugar production industry and recruiting Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) forces take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan is declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Chinese government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled the island until 1945.

For example, the widest film format in the world is 35 mm, which was superior to the size of film frames of the analog era.
Today it is also manufactured, but the most important thing, its sides ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is slightly different, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
It is said that the ratio of this formatting to the other (to get a simple whole number ratio by dividing by ten) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are similar to or very close to these sides.
A simple guide that creates a sense of warmth, despite being often disrespected and frequently belittled, is one of the few rules that retains the measurement of the image in the order of measurement.

His far-reaching influence stretched from kings to ordinary people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is to alleviate poverty and punishment, as well as to ease poverty and punishment, and the church's funds are used exactly for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, such a concentration of power and wealth has raised questions among the majority as to whether this rule is being carried out or not.
Hostilities from the U-boat attacks, Britain began to blockade Germany at sea.
Despite being codified in a number of international treaties from the past two centuries, the strategy was successful in breaking the accepted international law, by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain laid mines in international water areas to pose a threat to all types of ships, and to prevent access to any part of the ocean.
Due to the restraint of this tactic, Germany would have expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the majority of citizens and nations were dominated by a spirit of pacifism and isolationism.

Ancient China had a unique method of showing different periods of time; each stage or ruling dynasty was clearly a distinct dynasty.
In addition, there were periods of unstable provincial kingdoms between each dynasty. The most famous of these was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, fierce conflicts took place among the nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, during which thousands of people fought to the death for the throne of the luxurious palace in the city of Sian.

Muhammad is deeply interested in issues beyond this world. He often travels to the mountain called "Nur" (light) near the gorge known as "Hiro" for contemplation.
The Prophet Muhammad's own spiritual disposition shines brightly in the pages of the times.
Located atop one of the mountains to the north of Makka, this well is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knew of its existence, finding it is not easy at all. Entering the gorge is entirely solitude.
In the pit, almost nothing is visible, except for a beautiful sky and a few surrounding mountains. It is possible to see or hear only a very small part of this world inside the pit.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, located in Giza, is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
In the prehistoric era, dating back to the third millennium, the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramid, among many other grand pyramids, in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
Egypt's ancient city of Giza, or the "Giza necropolis", contains a number of pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.

Understanding the environment in which the order to create a system to understand the tampliyerlarni (tamperers) is necessary.
Events that took place at the time are generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, which are the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 1000–1300 years).
After the Upper Middle Ages, the Middle Middle Ages and conditionally from then on, around 1500 years, the Lower Middle Ages come.
Technological determinism – this encompasses a broad range of practical notions from technological drift or technological necessity through to the basic logic of human destiny being governed by scientific laws and their axioms in technology.
The majority of the characteristics of technological determinism embody two general ideas: that technological development proceeds mainly independently of political or cultural influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" in its own societies rather than being shaped by them.
For example, a motor vehicle can become a cause of improvement in the road condition, but it is possible to change.
The road network within the state is economically viable only for a few cars, which is why new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the price of cars.
The widespread presence of car ownership leads to an increase in road accidents, which in turn drives the development of new methods to repair damaged bodies in the field of healthcare.
Romanticism in Goethe, as well as in Hölderlin and Schlegel, had a major element of cultural determinism left.
From a romantic perspective, geography shaped individuals, and with the passage of time, customs and culture emerged tied to that geography, which were better than the laws of chance inserted into the community.
Paris is the fashion capital of the modern world, just like Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury began around the 4th century AD and continued until around the 11th century AD.
Her reputation declined mainly due to those who returned with more gifts, such as silks and spices, offered by the Byzantine market, rather than merchants.
The title of capital of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris exactly at this time.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The Byzantine culture had a strong influence on the court.
Due to the slowness of communication channels, customs in the West may have remained unchanged for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time, resulting from the Crusades, was the use of belts to fasten clothing.
A natural economy is only run for the sake of a peasant and his family to produce sufficient goods to meet their needs.
The auxiliary agricultural system is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds from an ecological area, or other relatively easy technologies to increase yield.
Many peasants have been involved in auxiliary agricultural activities throughout history, and many developing countries are still like that.
The individuals who feel neglected by social standards and are capable of developing the sense of self are brought together.
Discrimination can occur based on the age, ethnic origin, social class, location, and/or sex of individuals.
The combination of various factors such as linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, and geographical characteristics is possible.
Personality traits are often expressed by individuals in a style that includes mannerisms, behavior, and jargon, which they use in a unique and symbolic way to express themselves.
Social isolation of children at the age of growing up, or the rare cases of maltreatment through violence or negligence, are commonly used examples to demonstrate the importance of socialization.
Children are called "wild" or "feral". Some wild children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the confinement of such a child by their parents was due to the child's severe mental or physical weakness.
Children who are taken away or run away from home may have experienced real violence or injuries before.
It is claimed that many of them were raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When fully developed by non-human entities, a ferocious child would almost completely mimic the behavior of an animal that has been raised by a human, for example, fear of humans or disdain for them, within the physical boundaries of a body.
If education were based on project-based learning, it would be easier and more interesting, but it would also increase the burden.
The method of teaching is not a teaching method, but rather assistance to people who are using a new computer program or starting a new project, similar to those who are going through a new experience.
They can be both virtual and real, if you put it differently, a student notebook is of this kind, but also a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
This is an automated support program that is integrated into the system and is designed to help students with processes that are difficult for them to handle, ask questions, provide assistance, and explain things.
Children are handed over to the care of a guardian for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even abandonment.
They should grow up in an environment that is completely free from any kind of education, care, and upbringing, but they grow up anyway.

Our system must create safe homes, compassionate caregivers, sustainable education, and reliable healthcare services.
The hostess is required to provide all necessary items in the room that was left unoccupied.
It represents elements of public as well as personal communication on the Internet.
Using the characteristics of the Internet, in addition to the pleasant approach, leads to additional measurements.
For example, "education" and "socialization" are offered as important motivations for using the internet (James and others, 1995).
When investigating relationships with online forums, Eymey and MacKord (1998) found that "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" were also new aspects of motivation.
The use of videos has led to a number of important discoveries in the fields of micro-expressions and facial movements, which have been ongoing for millions of years.
It is claimed that by correctly interpreting small signs, one can determine whether a child is lying or not.
In Oliver Sacks' essay "The President's Speech", he demonstrates how people who are unable to understand the speech due to a brain injury are able to accurately gauge sincerity.

Studies of the 4th era have shown the existence of two genetic variation zones: hidden and open.
It introduces a new genetic mutation and accelerates the removal of the existing variant from the population.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations between both poles in each generation.
Outside the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system would have difficulty digesting amino acids from plant sources.
In addition to this, such behavior leads to the following serious consequences: an increase in depression, a lack of food supplies, and ultimately, death.
Fruits and vegetables from trees and plants with seeds would have been the easiest to grow, but for us, like primates, they are difficult to digest before cooking.
In contrast, available food sources (insects, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but also provide a high quantity of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, if our ancestors had solved their "youth problems" in the same way that modern men do, it wouldn't be surprising.
Sleep fragmentation — this is a deviation from your usual sleep time and a short period (10–60 minutes) of wakefulness followed by a return to sleep.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with many practices of Hindu Yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is also a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga is awakened with Kundalini power (gnostic power) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is considered to be spiritual yoga. Various chakras are cleansed through the visualization of different deities, energizing channels are activated, and a lucid mind is created.
Germany was the general enemy of the USSR in cooperation with the USA during the Second World War. After the war, the system, the process of development, and cultural conflicts led to a confrontation between the states.
Two years after the invasion, former allies have turned into enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would have taken 40 years to pass, and from Africa to Asia, through Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other battlefields, real battles would have had to be fought by proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the sole hope of a counterattack was forming again along the Romanian border.
However, with the Soviet Red Army's over 800,000 soldiers violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, as well as other bilateral and multilateral agreements, the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland's eastern territories, and the creation of frontiers in Belarus and Ukraine, these plans had almost become a thing of the past in a single night.
Shipping goods by using ships is the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The function of naval forces, by tradition, is to preserve the ability of your nation to move people and goods, while at the same time hindering the ability of your adversary to move their people and goods.
After all the recent examples of great importance, one of the last examples of this kind was the North Atlantic military operations of the Second World War. The Americans were attempting to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist the British.
With this, the German naval fleet, mainly using naval vessels, was trying to stop this transportation movement.
If the allies had not won, Germany could have conquered Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Fossils of these creatures are seen to have been trained in the hands of humans for about 10 million years before in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.

Wagons were first built in England as early as the 16th century.
Wagons were formed of nothing but parallel wooden planks, yet they were able to reach greater speeds than the tortuous roads of that day, and carry greater loads than the somewhat uneven roads of that time.
The iron road signs were thought out very carefully. But if iron were placed on top of them, the iron roads would become even more useful, it was slowly realized.
This has become a common practice, but it has led to more wear and tear on wooden axles of iron wagons.
As time passed, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first complete iron rails were manufactured in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, which humans began with Homo Erectus, who emerged about two million years ago.
They, as their ancestors, the australopithecines, usually walked upright.
Even if there was a possibility that Sahelanthrop walked on two legs seven million years ago, the specialisation of bipedalism was found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2–3.9 million years.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, join the movement to protect the environment, and even reduce future hardships to a certain extent.
This often resembles a symptomatic treatment. But if we want to go beyond just a temporary solution, we need to find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
The world has undergone significant changes due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, as well as the excessive growth of the population and the increasingly extravagant lifestyle of humanity, which has led to even greater problems for everyone.
On July 4, after being accepted by the Congress, a copy of the congressional resolution, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was later sent to a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the time, 150 to 200 copies were prepared, which are now called "Danlep yon zambaraklari".
On July 8, a document by John Nicolson was read to the public for the first time in the Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6 and played to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The existence of the 25 Dunlap broadsides is known, and the oldest surviving copy of the document is this one. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day, and that they are still alive today. We call them birds.
Most people wouldn't think of lizards as dinosaurs, since they have scales and grow tails.
However, many things are still related to birds, similar to dinosaurs.
They have claws on their feet, they lay eggs and they run like T-Rexes with two rear legs.

The main purpose of scientific research is to discover how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method will lead to many other scientific researches.
But this is not just an experiment, and the experiment - this is the formulation of one or more hypotheses, for example, and the service of observations for scientific research as well.
Naturalists and scholars focused their attention on ancient texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's major works, including his views on psychology, were accepted.
Greece lost its Western foundation of Greek philosophical and scientific principles due to a decline in knowledge.
Physiology and observed behavior show that many rhythms are often linked to the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
External periodic signals are simply unresponsive periodic rhythms in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, that have been documented.
It is a biological clock that continues to operate autonomously even without external signals.
The existence of genetic material was one of the main assumptions of the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Xershi and Cheyz used plasmids or viruses to transfer their DNA to bacteria.
They also marked the DNK in the cell with radioactive phosphorus, and the protein in the cell with radioactive mercury, and carried out two experiments.
Mutations are of a certain type, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are sex cells or not, depending on the type of mutation.
Only mutations in sex cells can pass to children, while any other mutations can lead to the cell's death or cause cancer.

Guest, I have invited you to observe and learn from their letters and to study them.
Every day in the morning, people go to small towns in their cars, and they meet with people who are already working there.
This is somehow related to a dynamic transportation system in the route, where each person is based on a personal automobile and supports it.
Currently, science shows that this massive carbon economy has been disrupting the biosphere for the past 2 million years, depriving humanity of its last stable state.
Each person is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost all people use transportation systems.
In developed countries, you are hardly ever witness to complaints about the quality of tap water or the collapse of bridges like this.
Why do transportation systems produce such complaints, why do they make mistakes every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more serious at play?
Traffic flow observation – the study of separate drivers and their vehicles' movements and their mutual relationships relative to each other.
It's unfortunate, studying the flow of traffic is difficult, as the driver's actions can't be predicted with a hundred percent accuracy beforehand.
It's good, young people are more likely to be in a more open environment; therefore, the flow rates are somewhat open and mathematically can be expressed approximately.
For better representation of the flow, the following three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in planning road objects, designing them, and exploiting them.
Insects rose into the air as the first refugees. Their ability to fly made it easier to escape from enemies, as well as to find food and partners more effectively.

They are all possible to be found in their natural form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with the help of simple tools, which is why people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle previously proposed the theory that everything is composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembles the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it also created a theoretical concept of new states of matter for the transformation of these into things we see.
Mixtures are mainly composed of two or more metals, let's forget about many elements in the periodic table.
Calcium and similar elements are considered metals. Of course, silver and gold, like metals, are also present.
In addition, it is also possible for you to have a certain amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, present in compounds that are capable of forming.
Matter makes up everything in the universe. Tiny particles called atoms are what make up matter.

Content analysis focuses on identifying things that influence or attract people.
These theories show that, until humans take a step into adulthood, they have certain inner needs and/or desires.
These theories examine what makes known individuals want to do certain tasks and how environmental factors influence whether they do or don't do these things.
The two famous theories of curiosity in terms of nature are Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" theory and Gersberg's "Two Drives" theory.
In general, when managers start to take leadership from their former colleagues, two types of behavior may emerge. One end of the spectrum is the "one of the kids" (or one of the girls) type, who tries to hold on to their old status.
These types of managers are reluctant to make decisions, look for disciplinary measures, assess work quality, assign tasks, and punish people for accountability.
On the other spectrum, a human group turns out to be everything they've done so far, and transforms into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they can change everything.
The leading team is responsible for both its success and failure.
In many cases, such leaders and members of the group are the cause of disagreements between them.
Virtual teams are on par with traditional teams in terms of quality standards, but there are imperceptible differences.
Members of virtual groups often perform the function of a physical group's communication point.
Their teams often have more autonomy than traditional teams, due to the possibility of their meetings across different time zones being misunderstood by the local management system.
The existence of a "true invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a virtual team's own inherent component.
"The Invisible Team" — this is a management team for each member, which sets standards for each member. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
The educational organization wants to avoid going through a lengthy process for its establishment. The main goal of applying organizational educational concepts into practice is innovation.
In all functional departments of the organization, creativity and innovation are possible when all resources are used effectively.
As a result, for the customer to be served with new innovative processes, the process of working together with a consortium is possible.
Before becoming an innovation organization, leadership must first establish an innovation culture, as well as promote knowledge exchange and organizational training.

This helps us to understand the processes in our own minds by providing us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models.
Even if AI is powerful in scientific fantasy meaning, AI occupies a very important area of computer science in machine learning, artificial intelligence and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI is focused on automating tasks that require intelligent actions, such as creating machines that perform tasks on their own.
Supervision, planning, and schedule creation, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voice, and face can serve as examples.
Things that were once aimed at solving real-life problems have become separate fields of study.
Today, as much as computers and video game software are integrated into household computers, AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Excursions are a major part of any class. In many cases, the teacher wants to take his students on a trip to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers an alternative to solving problems through virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts while seated in their class, visit an aquarium, or indulge in beautiful art.
Virtual excursions are a great way to think about travel, and exchanging experiences with future classes.
Students at Bennett School in Northern Carolina create a website annually about their trips to the state capital, the website is annually redesigned, but old versions are saved online as an album.
