The people were dying in the streets, in the markets, and in the homes. They were dying in the hospitals, in the clinics, and in the health centers. They were dying in the schools, in the universities, and in the mosques. They were dying in the churches, in the synagogues, and in the temples. They were dying in the streets, in the alleys, and in the alleys of the poor. They were dying in the alleys of the rich, in the alleys of the powerful, and in the alleys of the corrupt. They were dying in the alleys of the politicians, in the alleys of the businessmen, and in the alleys of the warlords. They were dying in the alleys of the oppressors, in the alleys of the exploiters, and in the alleys of the tyrants. They were dying in the alleys of the people, in the alleys of the masses, and in the alleys of the poor. They were dying in the alleys of the hungry, in the alleys of the thirsty, and in the alleys of the naked. They were dying in the alleys of the sick, in the alleys of the injured, and in the alleys of the dying.
