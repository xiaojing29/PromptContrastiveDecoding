One of the most common methods used to demonstrate social importance is to engage in a number of unpleasant events with children, which, due to the lack of reason, bad behavior, or brutal violence from the part of adults during their youth, were not taken into account by society.
Children were called "ёбоӣ" or "waҳshӣ". Some children were restricted by people (usually by their parents); in some cases, a child's hand was slapped as a result of a parent's rejection of a child's serious emotional or physical harm.
Possibly, children of the disabled are before being abandoned or sent to the care of relatives or facing injury.
It is estimated that some animals are left to their own devices; for example, it is said that some live independently in the wild.
