One of the most common methods used to demonstrate social importance is to engage in a number of unpleasant events with children, which, due to the lack of reason, bad behavior, or brutal violence from the part of adults during their youth, were not taken into account by society.
Children were called "—ë–±–æ”£" or "wa“≥sh”£". Some children were restricted by people (usually by their parents); in some cases, a child's hand was slapped as a result of a parent's rejection of a child's serious emotional or physical harm.
Possibly, children of the disabled are before being abandoned or sent to the care of relatives or facing injury.
It is estimated that some animals are left to their own devices; for example, it is said that some live independently in the wild.

However, the source text seems to be incomplete. If you provide the complete text, I'll be happy to translate it accurately, fluently, and fully.
All edible plant resources are safe as long as they are contained in fruits and berries, but if they are not ripe, it is difficult for primates like us to digest them.
In addition to being easily digestible, animal food (insects, termites, eggs) not only has a high content of proteins, but also a large quantity of fatty substances, which contain all the essential amino acids.
In spite of all the difficulties of the past, we should not be surprised that we have "solved" our own "white problem" in the same way that chimpanzees have solved it in the savannah.
