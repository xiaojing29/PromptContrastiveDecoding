It is still being maintained today, but what is more important is that its display ratio is preserved through digital camera image processors in the form of legacy.
The meter 35 has a shape that is somewhat cylindrical, being approximately 36 mm in diameter and 24 mm in height.

Everyone participates in society and uses modes of transportation. Everyone at least uses modes of transportation and complains about them.
