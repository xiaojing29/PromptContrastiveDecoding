This confirms not only the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is usually difficult to obtain by studying fossils, such as about color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the color of this animal was chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow tint on the opposite side.
This discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the pterosaur has a poorly developed tail - rachis, but has other feather-like structures - quill knobs, researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a late evolutionary change compared to the other quill knobs.
It appears that, based on the structure of the feathers, one can come to the conclusion that it was used not for flight, but rather, more likely, to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers allowed that even despite the fact that it was a tail of a young dinosaur, the examples can be seen not of bird down, but of mature plumage.
Researchers allow that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the pattern visible in the specimen can be seen as a feathering of a mature animal, not a down of a bird nestling.

The voting process in France was traditionally not high-tech. Voting booths were closed, so that voters could obtain beforehand a printed sheet of paper, on which the name of the corresponding candidate was marked, and then put it in an envelope.
After identification by the official persons, the voter last lowers the ballot into the ballot box for voting and puts their signature in the list of voters.

In this way, by moving this device in the air, players will be able to control their actions and movements during the video game.
Not long after the start, Giancarlo Fisichella lost control of the car and ended the race.
Fernanda Alonso, his teammate in the team, led the race for the most part, but immediately after the pit stop, he finished it, possibly because the right rear wheel was poorly tightened.
Michael Schumacher finished the race almost immediately after Alonso due to the fact that in numerous collisions during the race he damaged the suspension.
If one believes the press conference transcript, he said, "what she is is lovely and, in addition, she sings wonderfully."

She has been held in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, as she is charged with the murder of her son.
She is waiting for indictment and trial, being under arrest. However, considering that her photographs were published many times, any testimony of witnesses can be put under doubt.
In other regions of the United Kingdom, this is a widespread practice, but in Scotland, the judiciary works differently – courts consider that the publication of photographs may potentially be harmful.

On the large anti-government protests, which began in October, Martel replied to the commission.
The reason for the protests' accents, which were sometimes loud and resolute, became the lack of choice, some of which were not even held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPhones were registered. This led to the emergence of six fires, and four people received minor burns.

The number of people expressing opposition to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections).
During the federal election campaign of 2010, Julia Gillard, as acting Prime Minister, stated that, in her opinion, at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This view is shared by 34 percent of the survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
Almost a third of those polled, 29 per cent, believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent hold the opposite view that it should never happen.

The likelihood of a match being played behind closed doors without the participation of the home team's fans increased, as it is entirely possible that there may not be enough transportation means.
About the formation of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador is written in a study, which was published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
According to a report by Princeton University researchers (USA) and Uppsala University researchers (Sweden), the evolution of the new species took place in just two generations, although it was previously considered to require more time. The emergence of the new species became possible due to the crossing of an endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortes) with a non-native cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
You can make various forms from gold. You can cut it into thin sheets.
It can be pulled out into thin wire, which can then be wound and crimped without any problems. It can also, in addition, be divided or cut into strips.
It can be made very thin and attached to a second metal. He could be so thin that from time to time with its help they decorated the illustrated images in books, so-called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level of a previously chemical substance is determined on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
The ion of hydrogen is imagined as a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, the atom of hydrogen consists of one proton and one electron).
Twirl these two dry parachutes around in a circle until they merge into one whole, and then with wet hands make a ball out of them.
The lichen on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. At the same time, a kind of envelope forms.
In every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, a washbasin could be found, which was connected to a complex drainage system.
In the houses of Greek cities on Crete and Santorini, which belong to the Minoan period, the remains of sewage systems were found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, where men and women were together.
You are a traveler, if you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, a satellite receives a call, after which it almost instantly reflects it back.
The rockets were used to launch a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because of the Earth's atmosphere's influence, as light bends and the image distorts.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The world has changed in an incredible way. The biggest thing that has made it easier and faster to move around is what the car has done for us.
Thanks to him, we got trains, cars, and many other transportation means.
In the lower layers are medium-sized cats. Their hunting is also of medium size - they hunt both hares and antelopes with deer.
In addition to all this, many small cats (including home-reared kittens on free range) catch and eat a much greater small catch - insects, rodents, frogs, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the fact that each one occupies its niche, i.e. has its own unique function, and therefore does not have to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most social cats: they live in large prides, known as prides.
A pride can include up to three adult males, which are relatives, as well as thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females become close relatives, forming a large family with sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is in many ways similar. The last can strongly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to the prey.
Tigers can climb (but not so well), jump over large distances, swim and pull with force five times stronger than a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to one group with lions, leopards, and jaguars (Pantherean family). None of the other cats, except these four, can roar.
The tiger's roar is more like a short, sharp phrase consisting of sharp and loud words than a full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots use small animals as food. If possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are significantly smaller than ocelots.
Scientists believe that female beetles pursue and find their prey by smell, sniffing out traces on the ground.
Thanks to their keen sense of sight, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. They are attracted to aphids, merging with their surroundings and emerging from hiding to attack their prey.
If a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originated (say, through migration across a river or a mountain range, or if such living organisms migrate to a new island, so that returning to it would be quite difficult), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from that from which they came.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors will be present, so in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need other traits or adaptations compared to those it had earlier.
The original population has not changed at all: it still needs to adapt, just as it did before.
As time goes on, to the extent that the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, animals increasingly resemble the main population from which they diverged.
Thousands or even millions of years ago, and earlier or later, the two mentioned populations will look so different that nobody will even think to attribute them to the same species.
This process we call speciation, which in fact means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe. They, in addition to this, use carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "prepare" themselves food from sunlight through photosynthesis. Besides that, they give shade.
We will build with plants and make clothes from them. We mainly eat plants. And animals would not have survived without plants either.
For their own time, mazazurs were over-daring, so they did not fear anything or anyone, except other mazazurs.
He had more than 70 sharp teeth, like a razor, and an additional row in the upper part of his mouth, which meant that he could not be saved.
It is not precisely known, but it is possible that it had a divided tongue. The diet of mazazuras consisted of large fish, turtles and other mazazuras. It is likely that they also used representatives of their species as food.
In addition to that, he was throwing everything that fell into the water; his paddle was not worth even such a giant as the tyrannosaurus rex.
Despite the fact that their food would not have caused us much surprise, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were deer, hares, snails, and one of the rodents, known as the hazelnut mouse.
Another difference was that when the poor and women ate, sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets, on which they ate and fell asleep at the same time.
In the storehouses that cooked in Ancient Rome, products that entered Europe from America or Asia later could not enter.
They didn't have, in particular, any potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa. It also needs to be added that no ancient Roman ever had the possibility of having an Indian curry.
Each inhabitant of Babylon built the main temple, which was considered his house.
The vernaki brought sacrifices to their gods, while the zhretsy tried to satisfy their needs, conducting in their honor various holidays and ceremonies.
In every church there was its own open inner courtyard and a chapel, to which only priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers, similar to pyramids, were erected. They were known as zikurats.
The apex of the tower was a special shrine, dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, a house did not have great significance.
Most of the life of a Jewish family passed in the fresh air.
Women cooked outdoors; shops were simply open awnings turned to the street. Houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so timber had great value.
The territory of Greenland was not colonized. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, sailing west, he came upon Greenland, which he named the "Green Land".
But regardless of that, the Inuit had already lived there at that time.
Between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were many differences, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you watched the film "The Treasure of the Nation", you might think that on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was a map of treasures.
It doesn't match reality. Despite the fact that something is indeed written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, it was written: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The inscription in reverse is located at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, nobody knows exactly, but it is known that a large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded at the beginning of its existence to preserve it.
It could be entirely that this recording was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the landing in Normandy and subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate northern France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the control of the "Vichyites". This were the French who, in 1940, concluded a peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The operation "Dragun" began on 15 August 1940 – the allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" liberated all of southern France within two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in a society.
The term "civilization" mentioned above originates from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil" or "civic". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, i.e., "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". All this, in turn, somehow speaks to the size of society.
Cities-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, an even distribution and a stable cultural legacy.
Rarely are small cultures considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear, leaving behind no significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Agreement on the Formation of the Confederation of Thirteen States. The composition of this government included only the Congress.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive and judicial authority, it relied on state governments to enforce all laws, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
In addition, he lacked the authority to repeal the tax laws and tariffs introduced by the state.
In accordance with the Compact for the Formation of a Confederation to Accommodate the Changes, a unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states were so little taken seriously by the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, like the Germany national team, is one of the strongest teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula-1 racing are among the most popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, although Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is situated almost on 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective, as it represents a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century. It was exactly then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by, as 'Formosa' - this meant 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of milling. For the processing of rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Shimonoseki Convention, in accordance with which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, and it has been governed by Japan since then until 1945.
The Machu Picchu complex includes three main objects: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
In order for tourists to get a better idea of how most buildings looked at the edges of the complex initially, the last ones were rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular film format for still frames in the world is 35mm. On the eve of the era of analog photography, this film format dominated.
Such a film is still produced, but what is more important, the proportions of its width and height are now used in the formats of digital camera matrices.
This might be a bit confusing with the pantomime, but in reality, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Correspondingly, it is considered that the ratios of sides for this format (after division by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are 3:2.
Such similar relationships between sides have many widespread formats (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, often criticized and mocked, presents itself as simple guidelines that ensure dynamism and at the same time maintain a certain degree of order in the image.
If one believes him, the best place for the main object placement is at the intersection of lines that divide the photograph into thirds, in the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activity of the Catholic Church came under close attention, which became rich and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that took place, Christianity united European countries for over a thousand years.
All, from king to plebeian, were under her all-pervading rule.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity consists in the fact that wealth is to be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that exactly for this purpose there exist the financial resources of the Church.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Due to such concentration of power and wealth, many question whether this dogma is being fulfilled.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of military operations.
Embargo on the supply of vital goods of military and civilian purpose, although it violated the universally recognized international law, which has been established on a legislative level by several international agreements over the past two centuries, turned out to be an effective strategy.
Great Britain replaced international waters so that ships could not enter certain areas of the ocean. By doing so, it put even neutral ships in danger.
Due to the fact that no significant reaction to this tactic was observed, Germany thought that it would also not be subject to unlimited submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and countries over the course of the 1920s, pacifist and isolationist sentiments prevailed.
The states and peoples had the intention to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already become witnesses to the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, where he secured a job with Edison, which was located in New York.
All four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Batchelar (his manager from his previous place of work), were in his pocket when he arrived in the US.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to denote different epochs. At each stage of Chinese history, or in each family under the rule, there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, periods of dynastic rule were divided into periods of reunified provinces, during which instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Many nobles, who fought for the throne, engaged in merciless battles with each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the right to occupy the highest place in the great palace in Sian.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the conviction that the country belonged not to a single ruler, but to the entire nation.
Before that, various posts after the Revolution became accessible to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious ones rose to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier military ranks were awarded based on social status, now they are awarded on the basis of skills and qualifications.
In addition to this, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the limits of worldly life. To engage in meditation and ponder, he often visited a cave on the mountain of Nur (translated as "light"), known as "Khira".
The very cave that has withstood the test of time gives a very vivid image of the spiritual stations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Meki.
In fact, it's very hard to find her, even if someone knows about her existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
You will see nothing but pure beautiful skies and many surrounding mountains. In this cave, very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Pyramid of Cheops represents one of the seven wonders of the world that have survived to our times.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to honor the memory of a pharaoh-god. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a series of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were built for the pharaoh's wives and members of his family.
The sign that represents the movement of the slider up looks like "V", and down like a bracket or a square without the lower part.
"Ruch smyka ugara" means that you should start the motion from the end of the smyka and lead it upwards, and "Ruch smyka uniz" means that you should start from the kolodka (the place where your hand holds the smyka) and lead the smyka downwards.
The movement of the lips upwards usually gives a softer sound, and downwards a stronger and more confident one.
You can put your ratings in asterisks, but don't forget that printed symbols smiley face stand there not just like that, but with a certain musical reason, so they are usually needed to be preserved.
On 6 October 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (four-year-old Louis Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), as well as Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a hurry. Along the way, a crowd surrounded them – people in it shouted, lamented, and hurled threats at the king and queen.
Charles and the queen had to close the car windows under the pressure of a crowd of people.
At a certain moment, someone from the crowd pushed forward before the queen, who was already terrified to death, with the head of a beheaded guard from Versailles.
War expenses of the US imperialists incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
In order to pay a significant portion of expenditures and interest on bonds that were placed through Wall Street bank houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the US.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of US imperialists would have been the super-profits brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine oneself who such Templars were, it is necessary to understand well what became the preconditions for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages – this period in European history encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as is commonly believed, ended roughly around 1500 AD.
Under the term "technological determinism", I understand a whole range of practical ideas, from the pressure of a goal to promote certain technologies or technical necessity to a precise understanding of the fact that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their implementation in the field of technologies.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technologies to a significant extent goes beyond the influence of culture or politics, and technologies, in turn, make only their own (and not socially conditioned) impact on society.
In particular, there is a view that the use of automobiles stimulates the development of roads.
Despite this, if the number of machines is small, the national network of automobile roads does not make economic sense. Therefore, new methods of production are being developed that allow for a reduction in the cost of owning a car.
Due to a large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare, which allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A great element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When discussing the era of Romanticism, people were heavily influenced by the geography of their presence. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it emerged, which were better than explicitly introduced laws, as they existed in harmony with the place and position of society.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the capital of European fashion in feudal times.
Around the year 400 AD, the city gains fame as the epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened, mainly, because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were sharp spices and silk, and they were valued significantly higher than what was offered on the markets of Byzantium.
It was exactly then that Istanbul took the title of the capital of fashion from Paris.
The flowering of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
Initially, a strong influence on the style of clothing was exerted by Eastern Byzantine culture.
Eastern styles can take 25–30 years to catch up with due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. What people started using buttons, to fasten clothing, as a result of the Crusades, became one of the major events of the time.
In natural farming, the quantity of food products produced is sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Natural farming represents a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of saved seed specific to a particular ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other very simple methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Many farmers have historically run a natural rural farm. Nowadays, many countries of the third world are still practicing this.
Subcultures unite people with similar views who, from the position of social norms, feel themselves excluded from attention, and allow them to develop a sense of self-importance.
Age, ethnic affiliation, class, location, and (or) sex of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
Definition of an individual subculture can occur on the basis of various factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or their combination.
Members of one and the same subculture often define their belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manner of behavior, and slang.
In which illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, most often examples are brought up with children who did not grow up in an atmosphere of neglect, disdain, various hardships or abuse and who were not socialized as children.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children spent a long time in detention (usually they were treated this way by their own parents); in individual cases, the absence of parental care was a result of parents not wanting to notice serious physical or intellectual disorders and deficiencies in the child.
Before they left, and after they left, these wild children could have experienced serious abuse or trauma.
Others, indeed, bred animals; as was heard, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child was completely raised by animals, its behavior, almost in everything (considering physical limitations), reflects the behavior of the animal-raising animal: for example, such a child may fear people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further in this regard.
Scaffolding represents not a method of learning, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experience in studying. This can mean the use of new computer programs or the start of a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, an assistant can be a teacher, and a small component in a program such as "Microsoft Office".
In software support, virtual assistants are provided. They are necessary for students or listeners to ask questions, make suggestions, and explain procedures that are difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children can end up in foster families. This can be both harsh treatment and neglect, and even coercion.
It is unacceptable for children to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, raises them, or takes care of their education, but all this is happening.
In our view, the system of reception families is a safe zone for such children.
It is believed that thanks to our reception family system, orphans will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring foster parents, and stable education.
It is considered that the receiving family must ensure all the needs of the child that were not met at home, from which it was taken.
The Internet has become a means not only of mass communication, but also of personal contacts.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet, additional possibilities for its use and satisfaction of the audience's needs have emerged.
Yes, for example, the idea is expressed that such concepts as "education" and "socialization" are important reasons to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "stable relationships" were also defined by Amy and McKenna (1998) as new aspects of motivation in the study of audience reaction to internet sites.
Thanks to video recordings, important discoveries were made in explaining micro-expressions - these are movements of a person's facial muscles that last for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that a proper interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks noted how people with damaged brains, unable to understand the language, can nonetheless accurately gauge sincerity.
He even ventures to guess that animals, for example, domestic dogs, may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
Results of the 20th century studies indicate that there are two types of genetic variability, namely, visible and hidden variations.
Under the pressure of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and with the aid of selection, they are eliminated from the pool of observed traits.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination mix up the variations in these two pools.
In a savannah, plant resources are not capable of meeting the needs of primates in amino acids, if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
The more it doesn't work out, the more serious the consequences are. This is both unawareness and growing depression, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins found in legumes and leaves. However, if they are not properly prepared, they are difficult to digest by such organisms as us primates.
In contrast, animal-source food (insects, termites, eggs) provides the organism with a large amount of protein rich in all necessary amino acids and is also easily digestible.
I believe, in general, it's not surprising if it's discovered that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way as chimpanzees in the jungle today.
During sleep interruption, a person is intentionally woken up in the process of normal sleep and then falls asleep again after a short interval of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can achieve this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you, but not completely.
If you find yourself setting an alarm clock in a dream, try placing it in the other end of the room. This way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on bio-rhythms, it is necessary to drink a lot of liquid before sleep (mainly water or tea, known as a micturition aid) - this will force a person to wake up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The more vital energy is, the more beneficial it is, the lower the tension is. Absolute peace and satisfaction are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The basis of Tibetan Buddhism lies in the teaching of Buddha, which was supplemented by the path of love of Mahayana and a series of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga assert that to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of illumination), one must practice specific yoga postures, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
The Bioskaya yoga becomes a main part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualization of various deities allows for cleansing of energy channels, opening of chakras, and achieving enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the US became allies. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, a cold war begins – former allies turn into enemies.
She lasted for the next 40 years and in it, indeed, the armies of friendly countries really fought. The battlefields were located in various regions - from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, on Cuba, and in many other places.
Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along Romanian positions remained the sole hope.
Despite this, all these plans lost their meaning in just one night, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping cargo by ship is, of course, the most effective way to transport a large number of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of naval forces was to ensure that their country was able to outdo its people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from outdoing their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Britain, Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop the mentioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany, probably, could have won and conquered Great Britain in the same way as it conquered the rest of Europe, if its allies had suffered a defeat.
It is likely that goats were first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them in order to always have milk, cheese, meat, and skin at hand.
Ordinarily, home goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Not infrequently, they were tended by goat herders - children or young people. The latter played the role of shepherds. Such livestock is still driven today.
In the 16th century, in England, cart roads were built.
Although the oxen roads and seemed to represent only parallel wooden boards, they allowed the draft horses to move with greater speed and pull loads of greater weight than on existing uneven roads.
Tracks were used to hold the rails in place quite early on. However, it soon became clear that rail movement would be more effective if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
For a while, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first metal rails, completely made of metal, appeared in 1767.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), people began walking in an upright posture.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually walked straight.
The bipedal individuals of the australopithecus have been found in fossils, the age of which is 4.2—3.9 million years, but it is entirely possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs six million years ago.
You can be more aware of your surroundings, become a participant in the environmental movement, or even become an activist so that the mentioned sufferings do not become very strong in the future.
It often looks like a quick symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a simple time decision, then we must find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to technological and scientific achievements of humanity the world has significantly changed. As a result of overpopulation and an irresponsible way of life, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, a manuscript copy, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing office of John Dunlap, which was a few blocks away.
The night watch was made from 150 to 200 copies, known today as "Danlap Sheets".
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read this document in the Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
There were 25 of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs may have survived and that they even still exist, we just call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But birds have many common traits with dinosaurs at this point.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In the store of binary numbers, there can only be one of two values - 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, making immediate diagnosis impossible.
About internal poisoning first can testify an open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for providing emergency medical aid for this specific poison are necessary to be looked at on the label.
To denote this group of insects, entomologists use the term "beetle" in a formal sense.
This term arose because people have long known that it represents a bedbug - these insects, which are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Like brood parasites, so are nesting parasites, they have been domesticated to live in nests or in their host's home.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States. Accordingly, this non-neurological disease is the main one among young and middle-aged adults.
Disseminated sclerosis represents a disease that affects the nervous system. This system includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
As a result of the investigation, it was established that women suffer from RSD twice as often as men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in line with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
When adopting a child, the child's biological parents refuse their parental rights, so that the other spouses may raise and bring up the child.
The main purpose of science is to clarify the way the world functions through a scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
There is, however, not only him. An experiment (this is such a test that is conducted in order to exclude one or several possible hypotheses by means of questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists have devoted a great deal of attention to classical texts. Primarily, the focus is on the Latin Bible.
Generally accepted views at the time were those of Aristotle in all scientific matters, including the field of psychology.
As the number of people who spoke Greek decreased, the West found itself severed from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorythms that can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals to a great extent depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of a biological clock.
In many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been fixed, which are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even when external signals do not arrive, the mentioned process continues in the form of independent freely running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that claimed DNA is a genetic material was tested in the course of Hershey and Chase's experiment.
To implant their own DNA into a bacterium, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, in the course of which they marked the DNA of a bacteriophage through radioactive phosphorus or through radioactive sulfur - the protein of a bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material fragment in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are those of a germ line, mutations can have the most diverse consequences.
Hereditary mutations can only be inherited from germ cells. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting different natural zones and territories, as they want to experience the general view and landscape, including observing flora and fauna.
For example, what you can do in nature is fishing, hunting, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
One example can be given of visiting, studying and photographing orangutans on Barn Island.
People from small provincial towns leave their homes every morning in their cars to go to work. On the way, they pass by other people who work in the places from which they just left.
In this dynamic transportation circulation, everyone has some kind of relation to the private-car-based transportation system and supports it.
Scientific data indicate that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has to a significant extent facilitated human evolution over the past two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people participating in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you hardly ever start as many complaints about the collapse of bridges or the quality of water.
Why transportation systems become a constant source of similar complaints, why they regularly stop functioning? Is the cause in insufficiently competent transportation engineers? Or is something more substantial happening?
The concept of "transport movement" implies an analysis of the movement of individual drivers and transport vehicles between two points, as well as studying how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of transportation flows presents a complex problem, as it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with a high degree of certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite predictably; hence, as a rule, traffic streams are characterised by a certain rational, predictable order and can be approximately described with the help of mathematical models.
In order to fully and qualitatively show what the movement of transport means, three of its main parameters were established as interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The existence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as engage in their exploitation.
The first of the animals to rise into the air were insects. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can hide in various very small places to escape predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
One man, named Aristarch, thousands of years ago claimed that the Solar System rotates around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many stuck to another idea – that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) rotates around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because, being on Earth, it's hard to assert that it's moving, or is it not?
The Amazon River occupies the second place on Earth in length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is eight times greater than that of the river that occupies the second place.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, its width sometimes reaching six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, into which waters flow from over a thousand smaller rivers, has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, in terms of size and technical sophistication, no one and nothing was ever able to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were in awe of the monuments erected by their ancestors, the age of which had surpassed one thousand years by that time.
In the Vatican there live about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In legislation and official communications of the Vatican, the Italian language is used.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All citizens of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to this, people knew about the main chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) in their natural form, and it was relatively easy to extract them with the help of primitive tools, even in ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that any substance consists of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It looked like four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though, according to his theory, they can also transform into other substances, to ultimately become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or several metals. Note that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, the composition of which includes a negligible amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can, for example, be carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles - atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that in a point that stands at the end of this sentence, trillions of them can be accommodated.
In the end, when the otter appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the meaning and frequency of use of the letter decreased with the emergence of new writing methods.
People these days send messages on computer screens, and a touchpad is no longer needed.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new comes in its place.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb consists in the use of nuclear fission energy, when a nucleus is created with a large number of protons and neutrons.
This is apparently a cat on a hill very difficult to climb. Repeated division of the nucleus will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they have a tendency to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side is about 100 km.
The moon's shadow is thinner under a month's worth of clothing, and thicker under high mountains.
There may be more moors on the near side of the month, as the frost here is lighter, and accordingly, it was easier for the loaves to rise to the surface.
Motivational theories are focused on what drives people or what attracts them.
These theories stem from the idea that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they transform into internal ones and attribute a subjective character to (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
Mentioned theories describe exactly what drives individual people to want to do what they do, and which factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
"The Theory of Hierarchy of Needs" by Maslow and "Two-Factor Theory" by Herzberg represent two authoritative content theories.
In essence, when leaders lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can arise. On one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "their boy" (or "their girl").
In a manager of this type, difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of work, accepting unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility, and involving the guilty in responsibility may be observed.
The most extreme case is when a person changes to the point of becoming unrecognizable - feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and attribute it to themselves.
In the final result, the responsibility for the team's success and failure is borne by the leader exactly.
Rarely does this type of behavior end in quarrels between leaders and the rest of the team.
Standards of excellence for ordinary commands should be followed and virtual commands, but there are small differences.
Normally, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Considering that such teams can occur independently of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be unclear to local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The invisible team, which every member is subordinate to, is called the "command team". It defines standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to go through a lengthy process of creating an educational organization? Innovations - here is one of the goals of using organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and inventiveness can be revealed only when all available resources in the functional departments of the organization are used effectively.
In this way, the process used by the organization, whose employees are trying to jointly overcome some obstacle, may lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Leadership of the organization should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge exchange, and organizational learning. Only after that can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. This thereby narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The results of the research, obtained by scientists, confirm the presence of a close interconnection between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has been known for a long time that various types of cranial-brain traumas, focal damage, formations, shells, pathological changes, and brain tumors affect behavior and alter some of the psychological functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and hitherto unknown processes in it.
Thanks to this, we obtain a vast amount of materials and data for building imitation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" typically evokes associations with science fiction, in reality AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
For example, one can mention planning and control, the ability to respond to queries and technical problems in clients, as well as recognizing objects, voices, and handwriting.
They have been distinguished into separate disciplines, which study problems from real life and offer solutions for them.
Artificial intelligence is often used in the economy, medicine, technical, and military fields today. In addition, it is a component of software protection for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Not infrequently, a teacher takes students to such places that are impossible to reach by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, one can organize virtual excursions. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or fall in love with the beauty of works of art. And all this – without leaving the classroom.
Joint participation in virtual excursions also represents a very good way to think about a trip and share experience on future workshops.
Students from Benet School in North Carolina, for example, decorate a website about their annual trip to the state capital every year, and every year they update it, but in the network in the form of an album, old versions remain.
In addition, blogging can improve students' writing skills. Although at first, the grammar and orthography in their blogs may often "lag", this usually improves over time, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author does everything possible to improve their style.
In addition to this, the blog's leadership helps students better understand the world around them. The need is to support the audience's interest, inspire them, and force them to remain capable and interesting (Totov, 2004).
The blog's popularity fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs in a proper manner, they will be able to develop skills of analytical and critical thinking; active reaction to Internet materials will help students to outline their own position to something written by others, as well as to express their own views on separate problems" (Orawiec, 2002).
Ottawa – this is an interesting and enchanting bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous artistic galleries and museums that give the opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and its present.
The Niagara Falls lies further south, while to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
Actually, for that reason, and many others, tourists, newcomers, and other foreigners consider Nova Scotia a typical Canadian province.
On significant parts of its territory, which are located further north, almost no people live, and some are almost completely uninhabited deserts.
For comparison of population, one can bring up the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the US exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The Seychelles Islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Unquestionably, Madagascar is the largest of them. When talking about the living nature, it can be compared to a separate continent.
All smaller islands either become independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition to that, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and to the island of Mayotte.
In the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, it refers to the beginning of European influence and colonial policy.
The northern border of this region is the Sahara, and the southern and western borders are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to tourists-women always to speak that they are married, even if it is not so.
In addition to that, it might be useful to wear a ring (such that it wouldn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that will seem harassment to them. Locals often may touch tourists, grab their hands, and so on.
Decisively dismiss the men and boldly assert your opinion (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen around 10 centuries ago. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used the city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they left this place.
The Maroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar el-Badiss. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
You can easily find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as leather goods, pottery, tea sets, hookahs, and various souvenirs, but they are all intended for tourists only.
Goma — a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Homa changed from a land animal to a lava from the volcano of Nyiragongo. She buried under herself the predominant part of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is quite safe, in order to exit it, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out if there are any ongoing military actions in the province of North Kivu at a particular moment.
In addition, the city plays a role as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo. Here, very cheap services are also offered for mountain hikers - it's hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the inaccessibility of Timbuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor to denote distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu is a city where dust reigns.
In 1990 due to the threat from the part of the sand dunes of the desert it was included in the list of World Heritage objects threatened by danger.
Henry Louis Gates devoted a lot of attention to this city in the PBS channel program "Wonders of the African Continent".
Compared to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more, as it has a more Arab, than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of Southern Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park's area is 19,500 km². In it, there are 14 enclosures, each of which is home to different animals and different plants.
He is one of the most interesting places in the country, as well as considered the most significant of the National Parks of Southern Africa.
Like all national parks in the Republic of South Africa, the park charges an entrance fee daily and collects an environmental fee from visitors.
In addition, a worthwhile option may be the so-called Wild Card - a membership that gives the right to visit several parks in Southern Africa or all national parks of South Africa.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from the Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, forming the city's architectural appearance, are compared to a shining column diagram, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
