This confirms not only the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is usually difficult to obtain by studying fossils, such as about color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the color of this animal was chestnut-brown from above and had a pale or reddish-yellow tint from the opposite side.
This discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the pterosaur has a poorly developed stipe — rachis, but has other pteryx features — barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that, probably, the rachis was a late evolutionary change compared to the other features.
It appears to be a structure of feathers that one can conclude was used not for flight, but rather, more likely, to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers allowed that even despite the fact that this was a tail of a young dinosaur, on the examples one can see not fluff of a nestling, but a mature plumage.
Researchers allow that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the pattern visible can be seen as belonging to a mature animal, not the down of a bird chick.

About the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is written in a study, which was published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species took place in just two generations, although it was previously considered to require more time. The emergence of the new species became possible thanks to the crossing of an endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortes) with an alien cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
You can cast gold into various forms. You can cut it into thin sheets.
It can be pulled out into thin wire, which can then be wound and crimped without any problems. It can also, apart from that, be divided or cut into strips.
It can be made very thin and attached to a second metal. He could be so thin that from time to time with its help they decorated the illustrated images in books, so-called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level of a pre-chemical substance is determined on the basis of the quantity of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
An ion of hydrogen is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

You are connected to a companion when you call someone thousands of kilometers away.
In space, a satellite receives a call, after which it almost instantly reflects it back.
The rockets were used to launch a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because of the Earth's atmosphere's influence, as light is refracted and the image becomes distorted.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The world has changed in an incredible way. The biggest thing that cars have done for us is to make travel much easier and faster.
Thanks to him, we got trains, cars, and many other transportation means.
Medium-sized cats are found here. Their hunting is also of medium size - they hunt both hares and antelopes with deer.
In addition to all this, many small cats (including home-reared kittens on free range) catch and eat a much greater quantity of small prey - insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the fact that each one occupies its niche, i.e., has its own unique function, and therefore does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most social cats: they live in large prides, which are known as prides.
The pride can include up to three adult males, which are relatives, as well as thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females become close relatives, forming a large family with sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is in many ways similar. The last ones can strongly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to the prey.
Tigers can climb (but not so well), jump over large distances, swim and pull with force five times stronger than a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to one group with lions, leopards, and jaguars (Pantherean family). No other cats, except these four, can roar.
The roar of a tiger reminds one more of a sharp and loud phrase, than a full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots use small animals as food. If possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are significantly smaller than ocelots.
According to scientists, atractylis pursuers chase and find the harvest by scent, sniffing out traces on the ground.
Thanks to their keen sense of sight, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. They are attracted to aphids, merging with their surroundings and emerging from hiding to attack their prey.
If a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originated (for example, after being transported through a river or mountain range or if such living organisms migrate to a new island, so that returning to it would be quite difficult), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from that place from which they came.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors will be present, so in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need other traits or adaptations compared to those it had earlier.
The original population has not changed at all: just as before, it is still necessary for it to adapt.
Over time, to the extent that the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, animals increasingly resemble the main population from which they were separated.
Thousands of years, or even millions, will pass and earlier or later, the two mentioned populations will look so different to such a degree that no one will even think to attribute them to the same species.
This process we call speciation, which in fact means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe. They, in addition to this, use carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "prepare" food for themselves from sunlight through photosynthesis. Besides that, they give shade.
We build with plants and make clothes from them. We mainly eat plants. And animals would not have survived without plants either.
For their own time, mazazurs were over-daring, so they did not fear anything or anyone, except other mazazurs.
He had more than 70 sharp teeth, like a razor, and an additional row in the upper part of his mouth. This meant that he could not possibly escape capture.
It is not known for certain, but it is possible that he had a split tongue. The diet of mazazuras consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mazazuras. It is likely that they also used representatives of their kind in food.
In addition, he was throwing everything that fell into the water; his paddle was not worth even such a giant as the tyrannosaurus rex.
Despite the fact that their food would not have caused us much surprise, individual dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were deer, hares, snails, and one of the rodents, known as the hazelnut mouse.
Another distinction lay in the fact that when the poor and women ate, sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets at which they ate and fell asleep at the same time.
In the stores of ancient Rome, products that entered Europe from America or Asia later could not be sold.
They didn't have, in particular, either potatoes, or tomatoes, or corn, or cocoa. It's also worth noting that no ancient Roman ever had the possibility of meeting an Indian.
Each inhabitant of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered his home.
The Vernyks brought sacrifices to their gods, while the priests tried to satisfy their needs, conducting various holidays and ceremonies in their honor.

But regardless of its discovery, the Inuit had already lived there at that time.
Between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were many differences, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you watched the film "The Treasure of the Nation", you might think that on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was a map of treasures.
It doesn't correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is indeed written on the reverse side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, it was written: "Original version of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The inscription in reverse is located at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, nobody knows exactly, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded at the beginning of its existence for preservation.
It could be entirely that this record was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the landing in Normandy and subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate northern France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the control of the "collaborators". This were the French who, in 1940, concluded a peace with the Germans and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation "Dragoon" began – the allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" liberated all of southern France within two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in a society.
The term "civilization" mentioned above originates from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil" or "civilian". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, i.e., "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". All this, in turn, somehow speaks to the scale of society.
Cities-states are precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, uniform distribution, and a stable cultural legacy.
Rarely are small cultures considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear, leaving behind no significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Agreement on the Formation of the Confederation of Thirteen States. The composition of this government included only the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to introduce taxes, and since there was no national executive and judicial authority, it relied on state organs to ensure the execution of all laws, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
In addition, he lacked the authority to repeal the tax laws and tariffs introduced by the state.
In accordance with the Dammann Agreement on the formation of a confederation to implement changes, a unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states were so little taken seriously by the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, like the Germany national team, is one of the strongest teams in the world, ranking second among them. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.

Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, although Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is almost spread over 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective, as it represents a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century. It was exactly then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by, as 'Formosa' - this meant 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of milling. To process rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Shimonoseki Convention, in accordance with which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, and the last Chinese governor-general administered Taiwan until 1945.
The Machu Picchu complex includes three main objects: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
So that tourists could get a better idea of how the majority of buildings looked at the edges of the complex, the last ones were rebuilt.
Until 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular film format in the world for still frames is 35mm. On the cusp of the era of analog photography, this film format dominated.
Such a film is produced even now, but what is more important, the proportions of its width and height are now used in the formats of digital camera matrices.
This might slightly confuse with the pantaloon, but in reality, the 35mm format has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
In proportion, it is considered that the ratios of sides for this format (after division into twelve for obtaining the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are 3:2.
Such similar relationships between sides have many widespread formats (for example, the family of APS formats).
The Rule of Three, often subjected to criticism and ridicule, presents itself as simple advice that ensures dynamism and at the same time maintains a certain degree of order in the image.
If one believes him, the best place for the main object placement is at the intersection of lines that divide the photograph into thirds, in the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activity of the Catholic Church came under close attention, which became rich and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that took place, Christianity united European countries for over a thousand years.
All, from the king to the commoner, were under her all-pervading rule.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity lies in the fact that wealth is to be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that exactly for this purpose there exist the financial resources of the Church.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Due to such a concentration of power and wealth, many have questioned whether this dogma is being fulfilled.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of military operations.
Embargo on the supply of vital goods of military and civilian purpose, although it violated the universally recognized international law, which has been established on a legislative level by several international agreements over the past two centuries, turned out to be an effective strategy.
Great Britain was replacing international waters so that ships could not enter certain areas of the ocean. By doing so, it was putting even neutral ships in danger.
Due to the fact that no significant reaction to this tactic was observed, Germany thought that it would also not be subject to unlimited submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and countries over the course of the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed.

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, where he secured a job at Edison's company, which was located in New York.
All four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Batchelar (his manager from his previous place of work), were in his pocket when he arrived in the US.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to denote different epochs. At each stage of Chinese history, or in each family under the rule, there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, periods of dynastic rule were divided into periods of reunified provinces, when instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Many nobles, who fought for the throne, engaged in merciless military actions among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the right to occupy the highest position in the great palace in Xian.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the conviction that the country belonged not to a single ruler, but to the entire people.
Before that, various posts after the Revolution became accessible to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious ones rose to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier military ranks were assigned based on social status, now they are based on skills and qualifications.
In addition to that, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Magamet was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the limits of worldly life. To engage in meditation and ponder, he often visited a cave on the Nur Mountain (translated as "light"), known as "Khira".
The very cave that has withstood the test of time gives a very vivid impression of the spiritual stations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Meki.
In fact, it's very hard to find her, even if someone knows about her existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
You will see nothing of the clean beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Pyramid of Cheops represents one of the seven wonders of the world that have survived to our times.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids that were built to honor the memory of a pharaoh-god. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a series of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were built for the pharaoh's wives and members of his family.
The sign that indicates the movement of the slider up looks like "V", and down like a bracket or a square without the lower side.
"Рух смыка ўгару" means that you should start the movement from the end of the smyk and lead it upwards, and "рух смыка ўніз" means that you should start from the kolodka (that is the place where your hand holds the smyk) and lead the smyk downwards.
The movement of closing upwards usually gives a softer sound, and downwards a stronger and more confident one.
You can put your ratings in bold, but don't forget that printed symbols smiley face stand there not just like that, but with a certain musical purpose, so they usually need to be preserved.
On 6 October 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (four-year-old Louis Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), as well as Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a hurry. Along the way, a crowd surrounded them – people shouted, wailed, and hurled threats at the king and queen.

Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would have been the super-profits brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine oneself who such Templars were, it is necessary to understand what became the preconditions for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages – this period in European history encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as is commonly considered, ended roughly around 1500 AD.
Under the term "technological determinism," I understand a whole range of practical ideas, from the pressure of a goal to promote certain technologies or technical necessity to a precise understanding of the fact that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their implementation in the field of technologies.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technologies to a significant extent goes beyond the influence of culture or politics, and technologies, in turn, make only their own (and not socially conditioned) impact on society.
In particular, there is a notion that the use of automobiles stimulates the development of roads.
Despite this, since the number of machines will be small, the national network of automobile roads does not make economic sense. Therefore, new methods of production are being developed, which will allow the cost of owning a car to be reduced.
Due to a large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare, which allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A major element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When discussing the era of Romanticism, people were heavily influenced by the geography of their presence. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it emerged, which were better than explicitly introduced laws, as they existed in harmony with the place and position that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the capital of European fashion in feudal times.
Around the 400 AD, the city gains fame as an epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened, mainly, because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were sharp spices and silk, and they were valued significantly higher than what was offered on the markets of Byzantium.
It was only then that Istanbul took the title of the capital of fashion from Paris.
The flowering of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
First, a strong influence on the style of clothing was exerted by Eastern Byzantine culture.
Eastern styles can lag behind by 25–30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style by the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people started using buttons, to fasten clothing, as a result of the Crusades, became one of the major events of that time.
In natural farming, the quantity of food products produced is sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family exclusively.
Natural farming represents a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of saved seed specific to a particular ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other very simple methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Many farmers have historically run a natural rural farm. Nowadays, many countries of the third world are still practicing this.
Subcultures unite people with similar views who, from the position of social norms, feel themselves neglected in attention, and allow them to develop a sense of self-importance.
Age, ethnic affiliation, class, location, and (or) sex of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
Definition of an individual subculture can occur on the basis of various factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or their combination.
Members of one and the same subculture often define their belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manner of behavior, and slang.
In what illustration of what socialism represents and how important it is, most often examples are brought up with children who did not grow up in an atmosphere of disdain, neglect, various hardships or abuse and who were not socialized as children.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children spent a long time in detention (usually they were treated this way by their own parents); in individual cases, the absence of parental care was a result of parents' reluctance to notice serious physical or intellectual violations and shortages in the child.
Before they left, and after they left, these wild children could have experienced serious abuse or trauma.
Others, indeed, bred animals; according to rumors, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child was completely raised by animals, its behavior, almost in everything (considering physical limitations), reflects the behavior of the animal-raising animal: for example, such a child may fear people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further in this regard.
Scaffolding represents not a method of learning, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experience in studying. This can mean the use of new computer programs or the start of a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, an assistant can be a teacher, and a small component in the "Microsoft Office" program.
In the software support, virtual assistants are provided. They are needed so that questions can be asked, hints can be made, and procedures can be explained, with which a student or listener may struggle to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children can end up in foster families. This can be both harsh treatment and neglect, and even coercion.
It is impossible to allow children to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, raises them, and takes care of their education, but all this is happening.
In our view, the system of foster families is a safe environment for such children.
It is believed that thanks to our system of foster families, orphans will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring foster parents, and stable education.
It is considered that the receiving family must ensure all the needs of the child that were not met at home from which it was taken.
The Internet has become a means not only of mass communication, but also of personal contacts.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet, additional possibilities for its use and satisfaction of the audience's needs have emerged.
Yes, for example, the idea is expressed that such concepts as "education" and "socialization" are important factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "stable relationships" were also defined by Amy and McKenna (1998) as new aspects of motivation in the study of audience reaction to internet sites.
Thanks to video recordings, important discoveries were made in the explanation of micro-expressions - these are considered to be movements of the facial muscles that last for a few milliseconds.
It is asserted, including the fact that a proper interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks noted how people with damaged brains, unable to understand the language, can nonetheless accurately gauge sincerity.
He even ventures to guess that animals, for example, domestic dogs, may also be capable of correctly interpreting human behavior.
Results of the 20th century research indicate that there are two types of genetic variability, namely, visible and hidden variations.
Under the pressure of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and with the aid of selection, they are eliminated from the pool of observed traits.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination mix up the variations in these two pools.
In a savannah, plant resources cannot meet the needs of primates in amino acids, if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
The more it doesn't work out, the more serious the consequences are. This is both unawareness and depression of growth, and an unavoidable death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins found in legumes and leaves. However, if they are not properly prepared, they are difficult to digest by the organisms of such primates as we are.
In contrast, animal-based food (insects, termites, eggs) provides the organism with a large amount of proteins rich in all necessary amino acids and is also easily digestible.
I believe, in general, it's not worth being surprised if it's revealed that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" almost in the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah today.
During a break in sleep, there is a deliberate arousal of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and re-sleeping again through a short interval of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can achieve this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you, but not completely.
If you find yourself setting an alarm clock in a dream, try placing it in a different part of the room. This way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
In accordance with other variants based on biorhythms, it is necessary to drink a lot of liquid before sleep (primarily water or tea, known as a micturition aid) - this will force a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's internal peace is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and soul.
Present living force is all the more beneficial than lower tension. Absolute peace and satisfaction are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be reached by everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The basis of Tibetan Buddhism lies in the teaching of Buddha, which was supplemented by the path of love for Mahayana and a series of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga assert that in order to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of illumination), one must practice certain yoga postures, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breath control practices.
The Bioskaya yaga becomes a main part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualization of various deities allows for cleansing of energetic channels, opening of chakras, and achieving enlightened consciousness.
During the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the US became allies. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, a cold war begins – former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and in it, indeed, armies of friendly countries clashed. The battlefields were located in various regions - from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, on Cuba, and in many other places.
Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along Romanian positions remained the sole hope.
Despite this, these plans lost all meaning in just one night, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers, as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, entered the territory of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping cargo by ship is, of course, the most effective way of transporting a large number of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of naval forces was to ensure that their country was able to outdo its people and cargo, while at the same time preventing the enemy from outdoing its people and cargo.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of assisting Great Britain, Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop the mentioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany, probably, would have won Britain in the same way as it won the rest of Europe, if the allies had suffered a defeat.
Similar to what is believed, goats were first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to always have milk, cheese, meat, and skin at hand.
Ordinarily, family goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Not infrequently, they were tended by goat herders - children or young people. The latter played the role of shepherds. Such livestock is still driven today.
Already in the 16th century in England, cobblestone roads were built.
Although oxen roads and seemed to represent only parallel wooden boards, they allowed oxen to move at a greater speed and pull loads of greater weight than on existing uneven roads.
Tracks were used to hold the rails in place quite early on. However, it soon became clear that the movement along the rails would be more effective if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
For a while, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first fully made of metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), people began walking in an upright posture.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually walked straight away.
The bipedal individuals of the australopithecus have been found in fossils, the age of which is 4.2—3.9 million years, however, it is entirely possible that six million years ago, Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs.
You can be more aware of your surroundings, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that the mentioned sufferings do not become very strong in the future.
It often looks like a quick symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a simple time decision, then we must find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to technological and scientific achievements of humanity the world has significantly changed. As a result of overpopulation and an irresponsible way of life, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing office of John Dunlap, which was a few blocks away.
The nights were made from 150 to 200 copies, known now as "Danlap Sheets".
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read this document in the Independence Hall courtyard.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy reached London.
There were only 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence available at our time (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs may have survived and that it even still exists, we just call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and ability to fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the tyrannosaurus rex, walk on their two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary number system, there can only be one of two values - 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to establish an immediate diagnosis.
About internal poisoning first can testify an open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for providing emergency medical aid for this specific poison are necessary to look at the label.
To denote this group of insects, entomologists use the term "beetle" in a formal sense.
This term has existed because people have long known that lice represent a type of bed bug - these insects, which are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Like brood parasites, so are nesting parasites, they have been domesticated to live in nests or in their host's home.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States. Accordingly, this neurological disorder is the leading cause among young and middle-aged adults.
Disseminated sclerosis represents a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
As a result of the investigation, it was established that women suffer from RSD twice as often as men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in line with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
When adopting a child, the child's biological parents renounce their parental rights, so that the other spouses may bring up and raise the child.
The main goal of science is to clarify the way the world functions through a scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted with the help of this method.
There is, however, not only him. An experiment (this is such a test that is conducted in order to exclude one or several possible hypotheses by means of questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists have devoted a great deal of attention to classical texts. Primarily, the discussion is about, among other things, the Bible in Latin.
The prevailing views at the time considered the opinions of Aristotle on all scientific issues, including those in the field of psychology.
As the number of people who spoke Greek decreased, the West found itself severed from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorythms that can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals to a great extent depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of a biological clock.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been fixed that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even if external signals do not arrive, the mentioned process continues in the form of independent freely flowing cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that claimed DNA is a genetic material was confirmed in the course of Hershey and Chase's experiment.
To implant their own DNA into a bacterium, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, in the course of which they marked the DNA of a bacteriophage through radioactive phosphorus or through radioactive sulfur - the protein of a bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material fragment in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are cells of the embryonic line, mutations can have the most diverse consequences.
Hereditary mutations can only be inherited from germ cells. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting different natural zones and territories, as they want to experience the general view and landscape, including observing the flora and fauna.
For example, what you can do in nature is fishing, hunting, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, one can mention the observation, study, and photographing of orangutans on Barn Island.
People from small provincial towns leave their homes every morning in their cars to go to work. On the way, they pass by other people who work in the places from which they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation environment, everyone has some kind of relation to the private-car-based transportation system and supports it.
Scientific data indicate that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has to a significant extent contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
All people participating in the life of society use transportation systems, and almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you hardly ever start as many complaints about the collapse of bridges or the quality of water.
Why do transportation systems become a constant source of similar complaints, and why do they regularly stop functioning? Is the cause to be found in insufficiently competent transportation engineers, or is something more significant at play?
The concept of "transport movement" implies an analysis of the movement of individual drivers and transport means between two points, as well as studying how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of transportation flows presents a complex problem, as it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite orderly; therefore, as a rule, traffic streams are characterized by a certain rational, orderly regularity and can be approximately described with the help of mathematical models.
In order to fully and accurately show what the movement of transport means, it was established that three of its main parameters are interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The existence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as engage in their exploitation.
The first of the animals to rise into the air were insects. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can hide in various very small places to escape predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
One man, named Aristarchus, many thousands of years ago claimed that the Solar System rotates around the Sun.
Some thought that he had reason, but many adhered to another thought - that the Solar system (including the Sun and other stars) rotates around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because, being on Earth, it's hard to assert that it's moving, or is it not?
The Amazon River occupies the second place on Earth in length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is eight times greater than that of the river that occupies the second place.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, its width sometimes reaching six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from rivers on the planet.
The Amazon River, into which waters flow from over a thousand smaller rivers, has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, in terms of size and technical perfection, no one and nothing was ever able to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments erected by their ancestors, the age of which at that time exceeded one thousand years.
In the Vatican there live about 800 people. This is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In official documents and communications of the Vatican, the Italian language is used.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All citizens of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted with the help of primitive working tools, people knew about them even in antiquity.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that any substance consists of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It looked like four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can also transform into other substances to ultimately become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or several metals. Note that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, the composition of which includes a negligible amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything is made of matter in the Universe. All matter is composed of tiny particles - atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that in a point standing at the end of this sentence, trillions of them could be accommodated.
As a result, when the owl appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance and frequency of use of the letter decreased with the emergence of new writing methods.
People in our time send messages on computer screens, and a touchpad is needed by no one.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new comes in its place.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb consists in the use of nuclear fission energy, when a nucleus is created with a large number of protons and neutrons.
This is apparently a cat on a hill very difficult to climb. Repeated division of the nucleus will release some of this energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable. This means that they tend to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side is about 100 km.
The skin of the moon is thinner under the month's belt, and thicker under the high mountains.
The month's tides can be higher on the near side of the month to us, because the water here is thinner, and accordingly, it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Emotional theories are focused on what drives people or what attracts them.
The mentioned theories stem from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they transform into internal ones and attribute a subjective character to (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
Recalled theories describe exactly what drives individual people to want to do what they do, and which factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
"The Theory of Needs Hierarchy" by Maslow and "Two-Factor Theory" by Herzberg represent two authoritative content theories.
In essence, when leaders lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can arise. On one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain "their boy" (or "their girl").
In managers of this type, difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of work, accepting unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility, and attracting those responsible to accountability can be observed.
The most extreme case is when a person changes to the point of becoming unrecognizable - feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and attribute it to themselves.
In the final outcome, the responsibility for the team's success and failures is borne by the leader exactly.
Rarely such a type of behavior ends in quarrels between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Standards of excellence for regular commands should be followed by virtual commands, but there are small differences.
Normally, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Considering that such teams can occur independently of time zones, they often have greater freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be unclear to local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The invisible team, to which each member is subordinate, is known as the "leadership team". It defines standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to go through a lengthy process of creating an educational organization? Innovations - here is one of the goals of using organizational concepts of education in practice.
Creativity and inventiveness can be seen when all available resources are used effectively in functional departments of an organization.
In this way, the process used by the organization, whose employees are trying to jointly overcome some obstacle, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Leadership of the organization should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge exchange, and organizational learning. Only after that can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. This, in turn, narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The results of the research, obtained by scientists, confirm the presence of a close interconnection between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has been known for a long time that various types of cranial-brain traumas, focal damage, formations, cysts, pathological changes, and brain tumors affect behavior and alter some of the psychological functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and hitherto unknown processes in it.
Thanks to this, we obtain a vast amount of materials and data for building imitation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
For example, one can mention planning and control, the ability to respond to queries and technical problems in clients, as well as recognizing faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have been distinguished into separate disciplines that study problems from real life and offer solutions for them.
At present, AI is not infrequently used in the economy, medicine, technical, and military fields. In addition, it has become a component of software security for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Not infrequently, a teacher takes students to such places that are impossible to reach by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, one can organize virtual excursions. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or fall in love with the beauty of works of art. And all this - without leaving the classroom.
Participation in virtual excursions also represents a very good way to think about a trip and share experience on future workshops.
Students from Benet School in North Carolina, for example, decorate a website about their annual trip to the state capital every year, and every year they update it, but in the network in the form of an album, old versions remain.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language. Although at first blogging grammar and orthography in them often "hiccups", this, as a rule, changes for the better, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author does everything possible to improve their style.
In addition to this, the blog's leadership helps students better understand the world around them. The need to support the audience's interest inspires and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Totov, 2004).
The news of blogs encourages cooperation and stimulates students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs in a proper manner, they will "be able to develop skills of analytical and critical thinking; active reaction to Internet materials will help students to outline their own position to materials written by others, as well as to express their own views on individual problems" (Orawiec, 2002).
Ottawa – this is an interesting and enchanting bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous artistic galleries and museums that give the opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and its modernity.
The Niagara Falls lies further to the south, while to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its untouched natural beauty.
Actually, for that reason, and many others, tourists, newcomers, and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
On significant parts of its territory, which are located further north, almost no people live, and some are almost completely desolate deserts.
For comparison of population, one can bring up the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the US exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Unquestionably, Madagascar is the largest of them. When talking about the living nature, it can be compared to a separate continent.
All smaller islands either become independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition to that, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and to the island of Mayotte.
In the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a maritime route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, it refers to the beginning of European influence and colonial policy.
The northern border of this region is the Sahara, and the southern and western borders are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended for female tourists to always say they are married, even if they are not.
In addition to that, it might be useful to wear a ring (such that it wouldn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that will seem harassment to them. Local residents often may pester tourists, grab their hands, and so on.
Unhesitatingly, men, refuse and boldly defend your opinion (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen around 10 centuries ago. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they left this place.
The Maroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar el-Badiss. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
You can easily find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as leather goods, pottery, tea sets, hookahs, and various souvenirs, but they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma — a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was buried under lava from the Niyogongo volcano. She buried under herself the majority of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is quite safe, in order to exit it, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out whether there are any ongoing military actions in the province of North Kivu at a particular moment.
In addition, the city plays a role as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo. Here, very cheap services are also offered for mountain hikers - it's hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the unavailability of Timbuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor to denote distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu is a city where dust reigns.
In 1990, due to the threat from the part of the sand dunes of the desert, it was included in the list of World Heritage objects threatened by danger.
Henry Louis Gates devoted a lot of attention to this city in the PBS channel program "Wonders of the African Continent".
Compared to the other cities of the country, the city stands out even more, as it has a more Arab, than an African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of Southern Africa. On the east, it borders Mozambique, on the north, Zimbabwe, and along the Crocodile River, its southern boundary.
