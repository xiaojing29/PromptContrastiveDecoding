The scientific group has said that the shell of this animal is pink on top and orange on the bottom.
This new discovery also provides a profound understanding of the evolutionary development of the bird's tail as well.
Due to the fact that the rachis does not have a good level of mobility, it is called the backbone (rachis) but has other special features - the vertebrae and the smaller vertebrae - researchers have found that the backbone is a evolutionary trait in the later stages when it has these special features.
