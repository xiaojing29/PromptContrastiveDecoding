The meat comes from animals (deer, rabbit, squirrel) and is not only easy to digest but also provides many proteins that contain essential amino acids.
In summary, we are not going to be surprised anymore. If our ancestors had solved the problem of the Internet in the same way, we would have solved it on the farm and in the forest by now.
